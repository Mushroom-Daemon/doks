just get started and you'll get better and better.

Maybe this goes under the research part. Under "The Big Ones"

Here's the most important thing is persuasive writing:

Getting people to read your copy. It isn't hard to do.

But there are a few practical steps you need to be aware of. For one, your copy should be easy to read. That means no big words and no long sentences. No giants blocks of text.

emotional outpouring-----BE that person, the tired mom, the lazy bitch, the person who's riddled with insecurity (you? never.) ... my trainwell thing I sent to darian is pretty dope...

To get people to read your copy, make it easy to read.

Do not be subtle. Be bold. And say what you need to say over and over and over again.

Write all the time. Letters and postcards. Every opportunity that you can. Never worry about it being good. Just write.

Learn all sorts of things you'll never need. It make ayou a better copywriter and writer. It gives you something to write about!



write to ONE person. it's only one person reading the ad. My secret website. I have a secret website. It's where I post all sorts of things NSFW. My girlfriend sometimes reads it, which is embarassing, for both of us. I write to one guy. Very personal. From me to you. Period. (Just like how I wrote this.)

use a byline with your name and write in first person. or, introduce yourself in the into.

every communication is a personal one.

CLARITY



right short sentences. They're easy to read. folks don't want t try too hard.  You want people to read your ads. Short sentences are easy to understand, too. that's I portant. it makes them more likely to buy from you. When people understand your ads, they're more likely to buy what you're selling. when your ads are easy to understand, people are more likely to buy from you. this isn't the place for clever turns of phrase or fancy language or double meaning. hammer out the main bits. do it clearly.

don't be afraid to start your sentences with "And." And "because." Or "or." Read some Vonnegut

I love this writing. I find it rather audacious. never use words like audacious in your copy. it makes you sound like a pompous ass.

FEAR

As a copywriter, you're paid to come up with ideas. Good ones, ideally. Ideas that help your clients get paid. And you need to know how to write, too.

Like all creative work, a bit of magic is involved. You can't really claim your ideas. They aren't yours… they just come from someplace. And that can be a little scary—what if they don't come?

I think one of the hardest parts about this, esp in the beginning, of getting paid to come up with ideas is the fear of not being able to do it. there's a bit of resistance there, right at the beginning. the ideas come from thin air, they land on your shoulder. when I first started writing copy, before every assignment is thin "how the hell am I going to pull this off?"

what if one doesn't come? or what if you're tasked with something you've never done before? something without a guidebook? it can feel like a lot of pressure. the good news is it's totally doable, and one thing always works…

WHAT WORKS

I once read a book filled with nothing but transcribed interviews of successful peope. transcript from an interview that had been included in a book of other interviews. I don't rememeber who the person was or what they did or really anything at all about the context except for this lick:

"when nothing works, work works."

i've since shortened it to work works and make it your motto for overcoming fear.

it means that if you sit your ass down and take it one step at a time (those steps revealed here in a moment) focus on your task (more on that later) the words will come. the ideas will present themselves. you will sift through the grainy river bottom a river of self doubt shit and find the filtering gold buried inside. and it will be fun. and people will think you're some kind of genius.

sometimes I just make work goals w my creative writing. like, take this crap sorry I wrote and work on it one hour this week. twenty minutes at a time or whatever. cut parts out, add stuff in, play around and figure what it's all about. something always happens. there's a little bit of gold in there.

so how do you work? what is the work of making something from nothing? here's the first step: gather information. squirrel it away, stuffing your chipmunk cheeks, some other rodent thing. focus on what you know. sweep the mess into piles and let form reveal itself. it's in there, the glittering gold your sifting for at the river bank. it reveals itself. it just requires some attention.

the writing is getting a huge shovel full of river bed and dumping it onto your sifter. editing is the finding gold part.

when in doubt, KEEP WORKING. When I was writing this site, many times it went easy. but other times, i'd have trouble determining how to include something in the table of contents, if doubt myself, i'd say why am I doing this—no one's going to use it. no one cares. etc. but now it lives and that feels good. you can have that satisfaction, too. i'm too old, I should have done this when I was 15. I have too much coming up, this is a waste of time. there are real problems in the world, I should apply myself to those. but you know what? fuck all that. grind through and finish the project.

WHAT DO THEY WANT

I took a trumpet lesson one time. god, the questionnaire… I still don't know what you WANT. so you have to ask peope questions in a way that's common and simple and makes sense. don't ask what your customer wants. ask what they buy.

then ask why. these desires, there aren't many of them. you can skip over the basic survival ones. if someone is starving to death they don't give a god damn about the porch you're selling. people want to get laid, they want to be seen as successful because they want to get laid. they want to belong to community.

FOCUS

pomodoro. you can't get a ton done in 25 min. I use 33.33. at first, it may challenge you. you're building a muscle. get rid of your phone. work in a distraction free environment. I prefer total silence, cold and hungry ravenously chewing gum. mileage may vary.

the timer trains you. the timer is a technical doc thing too.
protect your time. get away from phone. turn off slack. nothing is so urgent it can't wait a few hours. tell your PM your work style.

a power session is 33.33 plus a fifteen min break. for creative work, breaks not only help? they are essential. bill a 33.33 min and 15 min break as 49 min. anyone has a prob with that send them to me. you will be astonished at how quickly and high caliber you can c get your work done. bill this. any probs, send them…

POISON

murakami says writers have poison in them, and I believe this to be true. the thing is,too much poison'll kill ya. smokin? drinkin, you gotta keep it in check.

Exercise (for your mind and body).

what else is my secret power? mania. how do I feed that mania? chewing. eating. where is your destruction? stop feeding it. let it feed you.

EDIT

Sometimes writers are free and easy and don't try too hard and come up with stuff that is really, really fucking cool.

The rest of us need to edit.

Probably a lot.

But that's the best part:

**When you start to feel overwhelmed and lost, walk the fuck away.** also the clean desk. This helps a lot. And clear your desktop and close tabs. This is the creative mind stuff. I think it has to be clear. Silence.

> "Look at the act of writing the first draft as giving brith. It may be a painful, long process or it can go quite quickly and with little pain. Then compare the editing process to raising the child&mdash;the caring and nurturing required to ensure a healthy, happy child."

EDITING

Getting your copy to express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words. Expressing the thoughts and emotions you want to convey with the fewest words.

Tips:
* Look for "that" and remove
* Vary sentence length for a good rhythm
* Hyphenate sentences to make them shorter
* Eliminate unnesseccary words
* Rearrange thoughts

Try to find periodicials and remove as many words as possible.
