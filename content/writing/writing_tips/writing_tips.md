Now that you've done all the work of getting to know your product, your prospect, and how you'll connect the two, it's time to talk about something that stops many kickass copywriters dead in their tracks.

Writing the pitch.

No matter how much you write, there will always remain this hesitation. I remember when I first started working as a copywriter I would have a moment of fear before beginning every assignment I was given. I'd think *How am I going to pull this off*. Because, let's face it, sometimes it feels like you're having to create something out of nothing.

Here you'll find a few tips for making the wrting process easier. Once you get into the work of writing, I think you'll find it quite enjoyable, if you don't already. Let's go.

#### Writing Your First Draft

(where do I put the thing about writing to one person? write to ONE person. it's only one person reading the ad. My secret website. I have a secret website. It's where I post all sorts of things NSFW. My girlfriend sometimes reads it, which is embarassing, for both of us. I write to one guy. Very personal. From me to you. Period. (Just like how I wrote this.)

One of the hardest things about being a writer is starting. When I first got into this gig, I'd feel a pang of fear at the start of every project. *How the hell am I going to pull this off?* I'd think. here's how I've managed, and still do.

To begin, focus on what you know. Think about your prospect, your product, how the two are linked. Who are you writing to? Once you've thought about all that, you're ready for the second step.

Walk away for awhile. Take a break. Go on a walk. Play a musical instrument or work on something completely different (preferably fun). Let what you know incubate in the dark recesses of your mind, or the warm cockles of your heart, or the SOMETHING SOMETHING of your loind. Whatever. Then, start the emotional outpouring.

emotional outpouring-----BE that person, the tired mom, the lazy bitch, the person who's riddled with insecurity (you? never.) ... my trainwell thing I sent to darian is pretty dope...

Just write and write and write until you think you've got everything out you want to say to your ideal reader&mdash;no matter how ugly it looks right now. If you're working with a template (a website wireframe, say) keep moving down the page and write *something* for every section. Do not stop. Do not hesitate. Write as fast as . . . Let the ideas&mdash;some ideas, *any ideas*&mdash;flow through you like greased owl shit. This speed is important for two reasons.

For starters, it helps you outrun self doubt. When I was writing this website you would not *believe* how many times my girlfriend heard me say "This is stupid. No one is going to read this. What a fucking waste of time." Supportive as all getup, she would smile and say "Someone will find this one day," or, "You're creating a resource for yourself at work" or all the other things that never help in the moment when I hate myself.

I would get overwhelmed because I didn't know how to organize all of the material. I had tons of notes I'd compiled over the years from other copywriters and reading ads, as well as my own experience, but I didn't know how to put it all together. What to include, what to exlude, that sort of thing. I'd want to quit almost every time I sat down to write, or finished something. It all just sucked. But that's the key.

Sucking.

My first drafts always suck. *Always*. More often that not, they're absolutely unrecognizable from later versions of the ad or content. If you can accept&mdash;no, *embrace*&mdash;the fact that everything you or I will ever write on the first go (or even the many goes after that until your project manager finally says "hey, you gonna turn that shit in or what) will just plain *suck*, you'll be able to keep writing.

is thetimer still going? keep writing. take you shitteist workavble idea, put it down, and keep working down the page. you aren't the next steinbeck or faulkner or stephen king. get over it. accept your fate as a shitty writer and just keep going.

... Which leads us to the second point of writing.

**Heading?**

That leads me to the second point, a quote I read by novelist Anne Lammott.

"Most writers don't know what they're doing until they've done it."

And I'll tell you waht. I've never read anything more true&mdash;at least for me. I start nearly every project with doubt and fear. *How the hell am I going to pull this off.* But, it always comes through, despite&mdash;or perhaps *in spite of*&mdash;the fact that I have no fucking idea what the final draft is going to look like... Or even what the story is about.

In my opinion, that makes the *worst* thing you can is think about the final draft while you're writing. I claim that the final work is *discovered*, not created in one miraculous fell swoop of creative genius. That's why you have to keep writing, keep moving down the page. It'll give you something to look at, to discover. Something to give you direction for the next draft.

If you can do that, you've mastered something fundamentally important and will produce something just fine.

##### Tips for Working

(also something about shutting the door)

Something I like to do is work with a timer. Each person is different, and we all have our creative process, but working with the timer helps me grind out work, I think, rather quickly. Here's my routine, stolen from a direct response copywriter far more successful than I can ever hope to be&mdash;the legendary Eugene Schwartz.

The following is an adaptation of the Pomodoro technique.

Writing is done in chunks of 33 minutes and 33 seconds. During that time, you write, or think about what you know about the assignment. You *focus* on the task at hand, whether that's writing faster than the Gingerbread Man runs or doing market research or focusing on what you know before the emotional outpouring.

What you *don't* do is fuck around with your phone, or reply to slack messages, or look at your to-do list or think about or do *anything* other than the task at hand. This will likely require some training.

The focus muscles need to be strengthened. This will likely tire you out in the beginning. That's okay. You're getting stronger, more effective. You're learning how to *work*&mdash;the most important part of being creative. (Everybody's got ideas, it's execution that counts.) So that's the deal. If the timer is still going, you're still focused on the task at hand.

If a superior has a problem with this, send them my way. You need to protect your writing time. *They* need you to protect your writing time. It is sacred. Stay focused until the timer rings. And when it does...

Take a break.

Walk away from the task at hand. Close your computer. Turn off your monitor. Get the work completely out of your mind. Do something else entirely. Play a musical instrument, talk a walk, workout. Hell, maybe you can even write some weird fiction to put on your secret website. Breaks like this have a few advantages.

For starters, it keeps you fresh. You're able to clear your mental cache which prevents getting "stuck" or burnt out by the work. When you hit it again, you should be a little refreshed.

Secondly, it help you come to the project with fresh eyes and a fresh mind. It's also like taking set breaks in the gym. Without some time for the muscles to recouperate, the creative well to refill, you risk overtraining.

I take 14 minute breaks. And yes, those are billable hours.












But there are a few practical steps you need to be aware of. For one, your copy should be easy to read. That means no big words and no long sentences. No giants blocks of text.



To get people to read your copy, make it easy to read.

Do not be subtle. Be bold. And say what you need to say over and over and over again.

Write all the time. Letters and postcards. Every opportunity that you can. Never worry about it being good. Just write.

Learn all sorts of things you'll never need. It make ayou a better copywriter and writer. It gives you something to write about!





use a byline with your name and write in first person. or, introduce yourself in the into.

every communication is a personal one.

CLARITY



right short sentences. They're easy to read. folks don't want t try too hard.  You want people to read your ads. Short sentences are easy to understand, too. that's I portant. it makes them more likely to buy from you. When people understand your ads, they're more likely to buy what you're selling. when your ads are easy to understand, people are more likely to buy from you. this isn't the place for clever turns of phrase or fancy language or double meaning. hammer out the main bits. do it clearly.

don't be afraid to start your sentences with "And." And "because." Or "or." Read some Vonnegut

I love this writing. I find it rather audacious. never use words like audacious in your copy. it makes you sound like a pompous ass.

FEAR

As a copywriter, you're paid to come up with ideas. Good ones, ideally. Ideas that help your clients get paid. And you need to know how to write, too.

Like all creative work, a bit of magic is involved. You can't really claim your ideas. They aren't yours… they just come from someplace. And that can be a little scary—what if they don't come?

I think one of the hardest parts about this, esp in the beginning, of getting paid to come up with ideas is the fear of not being able to do it. there's a bit of resistance there, right at the beginning. the ideas come from thin air, they land on your shoulder. when I first started writing copy, before every assignment is thin "how the hell am I going to pull this off?"

what if one doesn't come? or what if you're tasked with something you've never done before? something without a guidebook? it can feel like a lot of pressure. the good news is it's totally doable, and one thing always works…

WHAT WORKS

I once read a book filled with nothing but transcribed interviews of successful peope. transcript from an interview that had been included in a book of other interviews. I don't rememeber who the person was or what they did or really anything at all about the context except for this lick:

"when nothing works, work works."

i've since shortened it to work works and make it your motto for overcoming fear.

it means that if you sit your ass down and take it one step at a time (those steps revealed here in a moment) focus on your task (more on that later) the words will come. the ideas will present themselves. you will sift through the grainy river bottom a river of self doubt shit and find the filtering gold buried inside. and it will be fun. and people will think you're some kind of genius.

sometimes I just make work goals w my creative writing. like, take this crap sorry I wrote and work on it one hour this week. twenty minutes at a time or whatever. cut parts out, add stuff in, play around and figure what it's all about. something always happens. there's a little bit of gold in there.

so how do you work? what is the work of making something from nothing? here's the first step: gather information. squirrel it away, stuffing your chipmunk cheeks, some other rodent thing. focus on what you know. sweep the mess into piles and let form reveal itself. it's in there, the glittering gold your sifting for at the river bank. it reveals itself. it just requires some attention.

the writing is getting a huge shovel full of river bed and dumping it onto your sifter. editing is the finding gold part.

when in doubt, KEEP WORKING. When I was writing this site, many times it went easy. but other times, i'd have trouble determining how to include something in the table of contents, if doubt myself, i'd say why am I doing this—no one's going to use it. no one cares. etc. but now it lives and that feels good. you can have that satisfaction, too. i'm too old, I should have done this when I was 15. I have too much coming up, this is a waste of time. there are real problems in the world, I should apply myself to those. but you know what? fuck all that. grind through and finish the project.

WHAT DO THEY WANT

I took a trumpet lesson one time. god, the questionnaire… I still don't know what you WANT. so you have to ask peope questions in a way that's common and simple and makes sense. don't ask what your customer wants. ask what they buy.

then ask why. these desires, there aren't many of them. you can skip over the basic survival ones. if someone is starving to death they don't give a god damn about the porch you're selling. people want to get laid, they want to be seen as successful because they want to get laid. they want to belong to community.

FOCUS

pomodoro. you can't get a ton done in 25 min. I use 33.33. at first, it may challenge you. you're building a muscle. get rid of your phone. work in a distraction free environment. I prefer total silence, cold and hungry ravenously chewing gum. mileage may vary.

the timer trains you. the timer is a technical doc thing too.
protect your time. get away from phone. turn off slack. nothing is so urgent it can't wait a few hours. tell your PM your work style.

a power session is 33.33 plus a fifteen min break. for creative work, breaks not only help? they are essential. bill a 33.33 min and 15 min break as 49 min. anyone has a prob with that send them to me. you will be astonished at how quickly and high caliber you can c get your work done. bill this. any probs, send them…

POISON

murakami says writers have poison in them, and I believe this to be true. the thing is,too much poison'll kill ya. smokin? drinkin, you gotta keep it in check.

Exercise (for your mind and body).

what else is my secret power? mania. how do I feed that mania? chewing. eating. where is your destruction? stop feeding it. let it feed you.

EDIT

Sometimes writers are free and easy and don't try too hard and come up with stuff that is really, really fucking cool.

The rest of us need to edit.

Probably a lot.

But that's the best part:

**When you start to feel overwhelmed and lost, walk the fuck away.** also the clean desk. This helps a lot. And clear your desktop and close tabs. This is the creative mind stuff. I think it has to be clear. Silence.

> "Look at the act of writing the first draft as giving brith. It may be a painful, long process or it can go quite quickly and with little pain. Then compare the editing process to raising the child&mdash;the caring and nurturing required to ensure a healthy, happy child."

EDITING

Getting your copy to express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words. Expressing the thoughts and emotions you want to convey with the fewest words.

Tips:
* Look for "that" and remove
* Vary sentence length for a good rhythm
* Hyphenate sentences to make them shorter
* Eliminate unnesseccary words
* Rearrange thoughts

Try to find periodicials and remove as many words as possible.
