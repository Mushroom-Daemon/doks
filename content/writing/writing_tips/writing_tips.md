Now that you've done all the work of getting to know your product, your prospect, and how you'll connect the two, it's time to talk about something that stops many kickass copywriters dead in their tracks.

Writing the pitch.

No matter how much you write, there will always remain this hesitation. I remember when I first started working as a copywriter I would have a moment of fear before beginning every assignment I was given. I'd think *How am I going to pull this off*. Because, let's face it, sometimes it feels like you're having to create something out of nothing.

Here you'll find a few tips for making the wrting process easier. Once you get into the work of writing, I think you'll find it quite enjoyable, if you don't already. Let's go.

SOMEHWERE I NEED SOMETHING ABOUT WHO IT'S FOR; WHAT'S YOUR GOAL?

#### Write All the Time

Write all the time. Letters and postcards. Every opportunity that you can. Never, ever, ever worry about it being good. Just write.

#### Writing Your First Draft

(where do I put the thing about writing to one person? write to ONE person. it's only one person reading the ad. My secret website. I have a secret website. It's where I post all sorts of things NSFW. My girlfriend sometimes reads it, which is embarassing, for both of us. I write to one guy. Very personal. From me to you. Period. (Just like how I wrote this. use a byline with your name and write in first person. or, introduce yourself in the into. Make every communication a personal one.)

One of the hardest things about being a writer is starting. When I first got into this gig, I'd feel a pang of fear at the start of every project. *How the hell am I going to pull this off?* I'd think. There's a bit of resistence there. Here's how I've managed, and still do.

To begin, focus on what you know. Think about your prospect. What is their desire? What will motivate them to become a customer? Be an expert on your product. what is the key to linking your product and consumer? ow the two are linked. Who are you writing to? Once you've thought about all that, you're ready for the second step.

think about everything you’ve learned about the product. The problem you have to solve. Imagine the end result–sales, freedom, women… a pat on the back. Then, stop. Then, something else. Then, emotional outpouring. <- this is how i write my best secret website shit

Walk away for awhile. Take a break. Go on a walk. Play a musical instrument or work on something completely different (preferably fun). Let what you know incubate in the dark recesses of your mind, or the warm cockles of your heart, or the SOMETHING SOMETHING of your loind. Whatever. Then, start the emotional outpouring.

#### Emotion Sells... Not Logic

The most effective writing is *emotional*.



Buying something is an emotional event.

What has been an emotional event for me? My boots. I love them. And my watch to.

The idea is to create the condition where the prospect is in perfect, harmonic resonance with your copy. Emotions follow the resonant frequency. As does you copy. To get them to feel that way, feel that way. Maybe this goes with “emotion sells.”

In fact, every element is a tuning fork. The headline, the picture, the caption, the first sentence all the way to the final offer.

If you want someone to feel love reading your letter, love them.

Every word has emotions associted with it and tells a story. And all good sales presentations are an emotional oupouring or words, feelings, and impressions. You sell on emotion… And then justify that purchase with logic. (After the fact.)

See every word as an emotional expression of some feeling. A little story.

A courteous refund. It makes no sense. But people turn that word into what they need it to mean.

Signing the paperwork and signing the contract feel different.

John Caples, a legendary direct marketer, changed the word “repair” to the work “fix” and saw a 20% increase in response.

At its most effective, copywriting is an emotional oupouring or words and feelings onto paper. Method writing. Pour out your heart and soul.

Know the emotional reasons your prospect wants to buy. Feel them and express them in your copy. Read it through and add more passion, ever more passion. More passion, more sales.

[Maybe a “starting to write” section where you know the emotional reasons for buying. Start with that. Feel it. Write it.]

emotional principles in advertising:

Every word has an emotion associate with it and tells a story (a courteous refund, respectfully installed—doesn’t need to make sense. just needs to convey the right emotions) Every word is a story. material has a lot more sizzle than “:book”
every good ad is an emotional outpouring of words, feelings and impressions
you sell on emotion, justify with logic
feel those emotions!!! tuning fork!!!


*****

emotional outpouring-----BE that person, the tired mom, the lazy bitch, the person who's riddled with insecurity (you? never.) ... my trainwell thing I sent to darian is pretty dope...

Just write and write and write until you think you've got everything out you want to say to your ideal reader&mdash;no matter how ugly it looks right now. If you're working with a template (a website wireframe, say) keep moving down the page and write *something* for every section. Do not stop. Do not hesitate. Write as fast as . . . Let the ideas&mdash;some ideas, *any ideas*&mdash;flow through you like greased owl shit. This speed is important for two reasons.

For starters, it helps you outrun self doubt. When I was writing this website you would not *believe* how many times my girlfriend heard me say "This is stupid. No one is going to read this. What a fucking waste of time." Supportive as all getup, she would smile and say "Someone will find this one day," or, "You're creating a resource for yourself at work" or all the other things that never help in the moment when I hate myself.

I would get overwhelmed because I didn't know how to organize all of the material. I had tons of notes I'd compiled over the years from other copywriters and reading ads, as well as my own experience, but I didn't know how to put it all together. What to include, what to exlude, that sort of thing. I'd want to quit almost every time I sat down to write, or finished something. It all just sucked. But that's the key.

Sucking.

My first drafts always suck. *Always*. More often that not, they're absolutely unrecognizable from later versions of the ad or content. If you can accept&mdash;no, *embrace*&mdash;the fact that everything you or I will ever write on the first go (or even the many goes after that until your project manager finally says "hey, you gonna turn that shit in or what) will just plain *suck*, you'll be able to keep writing.

is thetimer still going? keep writing. take you shitteist workavble idea, put it down, and keep working down the page. you aren't the next steinbeck or faulkner or stephen king. get over it. accept your fate as a shitty writer and just keep going.

... Which leads us to the second point of writing.

**Heading?**

That leads me to the second point, a quote I read by novelist Anne Lammott.

"Most writers don't know what they're doing until they've done it."

And I'll tell you waht. I've never read anything more true&mdash;at least for me. I start nearly every project with doubt and fear. *How the hell am I going to pull this off.* But, it always comes through, despite&mdash;or perhaps *in spite of*&mdash;the fact that I have no fucking idea what the final draft is going to look like... Or even what the story is about.

In my opinion, that makes the *worst* thing you can is think about the final draft while you're writing. I claim that the final work is *discovered*, not created in one miraculous fell swoop of creative genius. That's why you have to keep writing, keep moving down the page. It'll give you something to look at, to discover. Something to give you direction for the next draft.

If you can do that, you've mastered something fundamentally important and will produce something just fine.


##### patterning

How have others sold this product? Pattern your approach to theirs. (This is a good one for the copy.)

Get the prospect saying "yes." The slippery slide. Make honest and believable statements. Ones you know they can agree with and not challenge. *You do not want them to challenge the copy*.

METHOD WRITING. BE THAT PERSON!

* The point is to anticipate next questions and answer (or tease) it
* Write headline. Will it grab reader?
* Write subhead. Will it compell reader to read further?
* Write caption for imaginary picture. Strong enough to pull them into first sentence?
* Write the first sentence. Suck them in like a vacuum.

Try patterning ads. Copying a format.

The thing here is this: there is not perfect formula, no template that all of your persuasive bits will fit into nicely. You must know the foundations of your pitch. Then, write it how it needs to be said. But I will help you navigate the templates we do use.

**Head-nodding Tags**

Use at the end of a sentence to illicit a "yes."

Couldn't you?
Wouldn't you?
Don't you think?
Eh? (Fucking Canadians. Nice day, eh? That's how they get you, eh?)



Who are the winners? What are they doing that's effective? Pattern an approach after theirs&mdash;but with a twist of your own.

##### Tips for Working/The Work Environment

(also something about shutting the door. I prefer total silence, cold and hungry ravenously chewing gum. mileage may vary. Qhewn you have the door shut, here's what you do (timer))

Something I like to do is work with a timer. Each person is different, and we all have our creative process, but working with the timer helps me grind out work, I think, rather quickly. Here's my routine, stolen from a direct response copywriter far more successful than I can ever hope to be&mdash;the legendary Eugene Schwartz.

The following is an adaptation of the Pomodoro technique.

Writing is done in chunks of 33 minutes and 33 seconds. During that time, you write, or think about what you know about the assignment. You *focus* on the task at hand, whether that's writing faster than the Gingerbread Man runs or doing market research or focusing on what you know before the emotional outpouring.

What you *don't* do is fuck around with your phone, or reply to slack messages, or look at your to-do list or think about or do *anything* other than the task at hand. This will likely require some training. You must completely eliminate distractions.

The focus muscles need to be strengthened. This will likely tire you out in the beginning. That's okay. You're getting stronger, more effective. You're learning how to *work*&mdash;the most important part of being creative. (Everybody's got ideas, it's execution that counts.) So that's the deal. If the timer is still going, you're still focused on the task at hand.

If a superior has a problem with this, send them my way. You need to protect your writing time. *They* need you to protect your writing time. It is sacred. Stay focused until the timer rings. And when it does...

Take a break.

Walk away from the task at hand. Close your computer. Turn off your monitor. Get the work completely out of your mind. Do something else entirely. Play a musical instrument, talk a walk, workout. Hell, maybe you can even write some weird fiction to put on your secret website. Breaks like this have a few advantages.

For starters, it keeps you fresh. You're able to clear your mental cache which prevents getting "stuck" or burnt out by the work. When you hit it again, you should be a little refreshed.

Secondly, it help you come to the project with fresh eyes and a fresh mind. It's also like taking set breaks in the gym. Without some time for the muscles to recouperate, the creative well to refill, you risk overtraining.

I take 14 minute breaks. And yes, those are billable hours. you will be astonished at how quickly and high caliber you can c get your work done.

#### What to Do When Overwhelmed

I work for 3, 4, maybe 5 power sessions in a row. After that, I'm usually toast.

Exercise (for your mind and body).

CLEAN YOUR DESK.

**When you start to feel overwhelmed and lost, finish your power session and then walk the fuck away.** also the clean desk. This helps a lot. And clear your desktop and close tabs. This is the creative mind stuff. I think it has to be clear. Silence.
