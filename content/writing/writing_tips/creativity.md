When solving problems look for solutions that have nothing to do with the problem.

Ask yourself questions!

think about everything you've learned about the product. The problem you have to solve. Imagine the end result--sales, freedom, women... a pat on the back. Then, stop. Then, something else. Then, emotional outpouring. <- this is how i write my best secret website shit

use prble =m satements...
I want to sell pinball machine
I would like to into them to uniqueness of this pinball game
I want to make pinball easy to buy and seem like fun.

Write a bunch of these... find one you like. Then list out your big ideas. Pick one that makes sense. Think it over. Do they gel? Incubate. Then write. emotional outpouring. and the points above... no, on the other page about writing the heading and all that.

1. Become an expert on what you want to sell (myslef)
2. Know your prospect. What is their desire? What will motivate them to become a customer?
3. Write your headline and vacuum suction. (name this and link it)
4. Write the copy. An emotional outpouring. Everything in your head, write it down.
5. Edit copy. As few words as possible to get the feeling across.
6. Incubate. Walk away. Take a break.
7. Edit. (repea steps 5 and 6 as necessary... but don't make yourself insane. art is never finished&mdash;it can only be left in an interesting place.)

Learn all sorts of things you'll never need. It make ayou a better copywriter and writer. It gives you something to write about!
