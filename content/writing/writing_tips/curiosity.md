Curiosity is a trigger AND and editing tool. Show both.


You've come a long way. You've learned this and that, this and that. All sorts of shit. So, here's a question>...

What do you think the *most important* part of persuasive writing is?

How Bob made $10K in 14 days making only an hour of phone calls a day.

Could it be the unique benefits of your product, service, or position? That seems like a good one. Or how about the aspirational identity of your prospect&mdash;their underlying desires? That's a big deal. Or, wait a minute, maybe it's all simpler than that. ... it's a set of guarantees that'll just knock their fucking socks off and leave them chomping at the bit for more. Is that it?

Nah. I mean, those things are cool and all&mdash;and they certainly do help&mdash;but they pale in comparison to what *truly* matters in persuasive writing. Ready for the secret? Here it is.

Getting someone to actually read the words you write. And the following tips will help you do just that.

First

<mark>I am about to tell you a true story</mark>. If you believe me, you will be well rewarded. If you don't believe me, I will make it worth your while to change your mind. <mark>Let me explain</mark>.

{{< callout note >}} I love the above text because it says basically nothing. But it gets ya reading. {{< /callout >}}

==This may surprise you==. ==In fact, if my hunches are correct simply reading this article may change your idea of aging for the rest of your life==. ==Here's why==.

As you can see, coaching can be well worth the upfront investment. You just need to make sure of two things&mdash;<mark>The next of which we'll cover right now</mark>.


for eyesight, blue is not a good color too. <mark>There are several reasons<mark>. First...

==But almost immediately, something strange happened==.

Bold, gut-wrenching copy. (==Which you'll see in a moment==.)

I've got something to show you you'll never forget.

==DC-10s Big Secret==: You've heard a lot of bad publicity about the DC-10. ==But here's something you may not have known==. (heading and subhead.)

When I put on the pair of glasses what I saw I could not believe. Nor will you.

You'll love the way we hated the Magic Stat thermostat until an amazing thing happened. (subheading)

You're probably expecting our typical sales pitch, ==but get ready for a shock==. For instead of trying to tell you what a great product the Magic Stat thermostat is, we're going to tear it apart. Unmercifully. (tease what's to come.)

But wait, we did find one good feature&mdash;a feature that led us to a discovery. (feature is ease of installation, discovery is wires are safe to work with "live.")

And that's when we made an incredible discovery
What made us switch from hating the thing to loving it? ==Read the following==.

Big deal. What's so great about that? Read on.

In that case, we invite you to listen to one more story. it's a classic piece of advice that just about everyone has received at one point or another&mdash;and why you should ignore it.

That would seem to be the end of the story. But it's not.

But _ is just part of the story. What you will read in the next chapter is just as important.

It turned out to be what I least expected.
But one of the most important axioms you will learn for becoming a great copywriter is my second axiom. Here it is.

The axiom in this chapter is very important and very difficult to believe at first. Understand this concept, believe in it, and it will give you a very good foundation for your future writing skills. Don't believe it and you'll fall into the trap that many copywriters typically fall into.

What Ginger whispered to me next took me by total surprise. In fact, there have been very few times in my life when I have been at a complete loss for words. But wait. This is a book on psychological triggers and not about the discreet goings-on behind the doors of successful direct marketing executives who are perceived by beautiful cosmetic executives as the answer to their dreams… So I'm not going to answer here. But I do in the appendix. It was very steamy.

Start the Ad

Begin your sales presentation with a giant slab of curiosity and promise a payoff that keeps them reading and paying attention.

## Plant Seeds of Curiosity

* There are even more techniques which I will reveal later in this book.

## Add Lubrication

Imagine your reader is sliding down through your copy. You want it to be hard to stop. Ending paragraphs with "cliffhangers" like the following have a mesmerizing effect on the reader, something like greasing ... Here are some examples.

* Let me give you an example.
* Let me review the procedure.
* Let me explain.
* This brings us very nicely to the next topic.
* He continues.
* Let's begin.
* Let me site an example.
* You think that's weird? Check this out.
* Consider this.
* But the elephant doesn't. Why? I'll explain.
* But there's more.
* But I didn't stop there.
* Now here comes the good part.
* Here's why.

If you've found this book informative so far, you will find this chapter fascinating. So let's start.

In the next chapter, you'll discover how…

But there's one critical part of the copywriting process that really separates the best copywriters from the rest&mdash;and we cover it in the next chapter.

## Throat Grabbers

aka fascinations

In the subject line and preheader, you have at most maybe 65 characters (10 or 15 words) to grab your reader by the throat and not let go until the message is clicked on.


Tease and conceal. Make it so they have to look.ze1

Fascination examples

 The Rules:
  • »   	Make value accessible with a single action (a click, like, opening and envelope, etc.)
  • »   	Make the copy conjure curiosity by teasing the value and embellishing the benefit
  • »   	Make all of it put an image in the reader's mind

Method writing. (this is the emotional tuning fork. emotions follow the resonant frequency.)
