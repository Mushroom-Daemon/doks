Buying something is an emotional event.

What has been an emotional event for me? My boots. I love them. And my watch to.

The idea is to create the condition where the prospect is in perfect, harmonic resonance with your copy. Emotions follow the resonant frequency. As does you copy. To get them to feel that way, feel that way. Maybe this goes with "emotion sells."

In fact, every element is a tuning fork. The headline, the picture, the caption, the first sentence all the way to the final offer.

If you want someone to feel love reading your letter, love them.

Every word has emotions associted with it and tells a story. And all good sales presentations are an emotional oupouring or words, feelings, and impressions. You *sell* on emotion... And then justify that purchase with logic. (After the fact.)

See every word as an emotional expression of some feeling. A little story.

A courteous refund. It makes no sense. But people turn that word into what they need it to mean.

Signing the paperwork and signing the contract feel different.

John Caples, a legendary direct marketer, changed the word "repair" to the work "fix" and saw a 20% increase in response.

At its most effective, copywriting is an emotional oupouring or words and feelings onto paper. Method writing. Pour out your heart and soul.

Know the emotional reasons your prospect wants to buy. Feel them and express them in your copy. Read it through and add more passion, ever more passion. More passion, more sales.

[Maybe a "starting to write" section where you know the emotional reasons for buying. Start with that. Feel it. Write it.]

emotional prnciples in advertising:
1. Every word has an emotion associate with it and tells a story (a courteous refund, respectfully installed---doesn't need to make sense. just needs to convey the right emotions) Every word *is* a story. material has a lot more sizzle than ":book"
2. every good ad is an emotional outpouring of words, feelings and impressions
3. you sell on emotion, justify with logic
4. feel those emotions!!! tuning fork!!!
