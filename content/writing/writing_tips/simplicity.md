You want to keep the copy (and offer) as simple as possible.


Everything must be as simple as possible while getting your message across.

The message should be so basic and uncomplicated that it doesn't take much to understand it. If you confuse, you lose. People don't buy the best products. They buy the ones they understand. Now that I think about it, this goes for partners, too.

Focus on what you're trying to accomplish and eliminate things that complicate or aren't necessary.

Words are stories&mdash;emotional images&mdash;and simple words carry the greatest impact

Keep your layout simple and clear&mdash;*no fancy shit!* (It can hurt comprehension.)

Is your offer so simple anyone can understand it? How can you make the choice easy for the prospect?
