EDIT

Sometimes writers are free and easy and don't try too hard and come up with stuff that is really, really fucking cool.

The rest of us need to edit.

Probably a lot.

But that's the best part:



> "Look at the act of writing the first draft as giving brith. It may be a painful, long process or it can go quite quickly and with little pain. Then compare the editing process to raising the child&mdash;the caring and nurturing required to ensure a healthy, happy child."

EDITING

Getting your copy to express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words. Expressing the thoughts and emotions you want to convey with the fewest words.

Tips:
* Look for "that" and remove
* Vary sentence length for a good rhythm
* Hyphenate sentences to make them shorter
* Eliminate unnesseccary words
* Rearrange thoughts

Try to find periodicials and remove as many words as possible.
