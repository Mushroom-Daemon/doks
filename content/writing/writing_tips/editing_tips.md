While some writers may be able to upchuck genius copy without needing to go back and edit, I'm not one of them. You probably aren't either. Especially since, if you've been paying attention, your job is to write the first draft as fast as humanly possible.

When you get around to your second (or thrid fourth or fifteenth rewrites) here are a few suggestions for tightening things up. I think you'll find the effort well worth it, and you final drafts will be *much* improved.

Here are a few quick tips for editing

* Breaks from content help freshen your mind and eyes... If you have time, work on something else for awhile before coming back to edit your current copy
* I find reading your drafts on another screen or device (than the one you use to write) easier to catching errors/find shorter ways to say things. If you're going to use your phone *turn off notifications*.

### Edit for Brevity

Get in, make your point, get out. Your goal is to make your point with the maximum amount of emotion in the fewest words possible.

Some things to consider:

* Fuck grammar&mdash;feelings are more important (caveat: unless your client's tone suggests otherwise)
* Use simple words. They're the heaviest.
* Search your document for "that" and remove/rewrite&mdash;there's ususally a shorter way to say it
* Vary sentence length for good rhythm
* Hyphenate sentences&mdash;makes 'em shorter
* Try rearranging your thoughts for more emotional impact

### Edit for Specificity

Find any vague claims in your copy and make them more specific (unless you're selling on hope LINK).

### Edit for Simplicity

You want to keep the copy (and offer) as simple as possible.

Everything must be as simple as possible while getting your message across.

The message should be so basic and uncomplicated that it doesn’t take much to understand it. If you confuse, you lose. People don’t buy the best products. They buy the ones they understand. Now that I think about it, this goes for partners, too.

Focus on what you’re trying to accomplish and eliminate things that complicate or aren’t necessary.

Words are stories—emotional images—and simple words carry the greatest impact

Keep your layout simple and clear—no fancy shit! (It can hurt comprehension.)

Is your offer so simple anyone can understand it? How can you make the choice easy for the prospect?

### Make it More Impactful

Sometimes, get your main thoughts and just rearrange them. Often, there's a more impactful way.
