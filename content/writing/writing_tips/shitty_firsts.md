Stolen from Anne Lammott, the title basically says it all.
The look of the first draft makes absolutely no diufference. It is an emotional outpouring. Get your feeligs about the product and how it should be sold on paper. If you can do that, you have *mastered* someething fundamentally important.

I suggest practicing writing about the shot your parents put you through, or your bitch ex wife, or...

(My ex wife is actually really cool.)

Here's the thing.

1. Become an expert on what you want to sell (myslef)
2. Know your prospect. What is their desire? What will motivate them to become a customer?
3. Write your headline and vacuum suction. (name this and link it)
4. Write the copy. An emotional outpouring. Everything in your head, write it down.
5. Edit copy. As few words as possible to get the feeling across.
6. Incubate. Walk away. Take a break.
7. Edit. (repea steps 5 and 6 as necessary... but don't make yourself insane. art is never finished&mdash;it can only be left in an interesting place.)
