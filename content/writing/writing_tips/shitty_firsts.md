1. Become an expert on what you want to sell (myslef)
2. Know your prospect. What is their desire? What will motivate them to become a customer?
3. Write your headline and vacuum suction. (name this and link it)
4. Write the copy. An emotional outpouring. Everything in your head, write it down.
5. Edit copy. As few words as possible to get the feeling across.
6. Incubate. Walk away. Take a break.
7. Edit. (repea steps 5 and 6 as necessary... but don't make yourself insane. art is never finished&mdash;it can only be left in an interesting place.)
