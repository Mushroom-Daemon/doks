The idea is to create the condition where the prospect is in perfect, harmonic resonance with your copy. Emotions follow the resonant frequency. As does you copy. To get them to feel that way, feel that way. Maybe this goes with "emotion sells."

In fact, every element is a tuning fork. The headline, the picture, the caption, the first sentence all the way to the final offer.

METHOD WRITING. BE THAT PERSON!

* The point is to anticipate next questions and answer (or tease) it
* Write headline. Will it grab reader?
* Write subhead. Will it compell reader to read further?
* Write caption for imaginary picture. Strong enough to pull them into first sentence?
* Write the first sentence. Suck them in like a vacuum.


Try patterning ads. Copying a format.

The thing here is this: there is not perfect formula, no template that all of your persuasive bits will fit into nicely. You must know the foundations of your pitch. Then, write it how it needs to be said. But I will help you navigate the templates we do use.
