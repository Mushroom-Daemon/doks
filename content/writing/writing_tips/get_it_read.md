But there are a few practical steps you need to be aware of. For one, your copy should be easy to read. That means no big words and no long sentences. No giants blocks of text. If you can't explain it simply, you don't know it well enough.



To get people to read your copy, make it easy to read.

Do not be subtle. Be bold. And say what you need to say over and over and over again.


CLARITY

right short sentences. They're easy to read. folks don't want t try too hard.  You want people to read your ads. Short sentences are easy to understand, too. that's I portant. it makes them more likely to buy from you. When people understand your ads, they're more likely to buy what you're selling. when your ads are easy to understand, people are more likely to buy from you. this isn't the place for clever turns of phrase or fancy language or double meaning. hammer out the main bits. do it clearly.

don't be afraid to start your sentences with "And." And "because." Or "or." Read some Vonnegut

I love this writing. I find it rather audacious. never use words like audacious in your copy. it makes you sound like a pompous ass.



The benefits are not the most important thing. Getting people to read the copy is.

All the elements in an advertisement are primarily designed to do one thing and one thing only: get you to read the first sentence of copy.

Nothing else. Each element. Every elements, serves a single purpose. To get you to read the first sentece of the copy. Don't challenge it. Just accpet it. The logo? You think it has some other function? it doesn't. It's to get you to read the copy. really.

Then, make first sentences so easy to read they suck you in. Short.

So short and easy to read your reader start to read almost as if being sucked in. The locomotive. when the ? starts to chug from a standingstil, it really works hard.the amount of commitment and every the train must exert is monumental. but once the train starts to move, intertia takes over. It gets easier and easier to fly down the track. So it is with copy.

Opening copy it aimed at holding reader's attention at all costs. Don't worry about features and benefits. Just get them captivated.

If your reader is not riveted to every word you write in the first few sentecnes, your chances of having them read the pitch are remote.

Just remember that the sole purpose of all the elements of an ad are to get you to read the first sentence. make that sentence so easy to read your treader is almost compelled to read it. grasp this and you're off to a great understanding of copywriting and the persuasive process.\

You want your copy to be so compelling people can't stop reading. Like a car wreck. They can't look away. Everyone knows you shouldn't look but you can't look away.

Start with stoeis. Offbeat, interesting and short. They don't even have to be related to your product.

He was a prisoner confined to a cell block. "give him one last with" his wife pleaded... (heading and sub)... then he sold a rowing machine.

^ so, what are the features of your product? how can you relate them to something else? he wrote this and then confessed to making it up at the end of the ad. "copywriting is not easy and sometimes you go a little bonkers."

Collect unusual stories!

Most of his stories were unrelated to the actual product. But they were fun to read and people read the ads and bought.
