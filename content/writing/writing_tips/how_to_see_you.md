Branding?

The Consumer Hero Club used enelopes of companies that had gone out of business. They did this to look smaller than they were. They just explained that it was their way of saving money and the environment and passing those savings on to the soncumer.

Show your values through everything you put out. Be so honest the reader is embarrassed for you. Share shitty reviews.


For me: People will pay for letters that are fun to read.

integrity: the look of your ad, the typeface, looking neat, etc.
