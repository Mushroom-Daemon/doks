buying environment:
this could also be the buying environment.
Ways to give your ad integrity:
  • The look of your ad
  • Clean and neat
Even the typeface you choose

Your copy has to set up the right environment. Don't use this word so much. Just get them saying "yes" "yes" "yes" or pique curiosity.



What is this? Is it elsewhere?

Also, am I being credible? I don't need to include *everything*. Especially what I don't know from experience.

*the experience of using it
* wht is the product *like* (a nose sniffind air)
* these products are just *top sellers* (this is the concept... winners, not the products themselves.headline: "Winners")
* don't sell the chess unit. sell the challenge between soviet and the comp.

This might just be the nature of the product.
