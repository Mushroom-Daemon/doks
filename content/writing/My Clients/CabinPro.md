### Customer Persona

CabinPro clients tend to be property owners--either land owners or campground investors--interested in making an extra buck on their property by providing a thoughtfully-designed retreat for couples and families to go and enjoy nature.

### Hesitations

While they may have a picture in mind, they are unsure of the steps involved in creating that vision--from working with a builder they can trust, to choosing the right design, and setting up their rental with the township. In short, they lack clarity on what they’re getting and how to go about it.

### Guide (Empathy and Authority)

Not only do we build rental cabins--we’re landlords ourselves. And since 2021, CabinPro has been helping investors set up thoughtfully designed, profitable retreat spaces for our clients and their guests.

* Longer timelines with larger companies
* No one to help you through rental process

### Addresses Fears

**Getting You Up And Running--Fast**

As a smaller company, CabinPro is able to serve our clients more quickly than companies with longer lead times. However, the truth of construction is this.

Delays happen.

So while we can’t in good faith promise an exact delivery date (due to supply chain issues, unforeseen weather or delivery mishaps, etc.) what we can promise is this.

Constant communication, keeping you in the loop at every step, and a company owner--who loves people, BTW--being just a phone call away.

### Urgency

Missing out on rental income

### Additional Information

* Even if you don’t buy, I’m happy to help you understand what’s needed to get a high-quality, profitable rental unit on your property

### Vision Statement

A world where families, couples, and individuals reconnect with God, each other, and nature through thoughtfully designed escapes that inspire connections, reflection, and lasting memories.

### Mission Statement

At CabinPro, we help people create unforgettable outdoor experiences. By guiding our clients with innovative design, expert craftsmanship, and meticulous attention to detail, we ensure every moment spent in their cabin immerses them in nature, comfort, and inspiration.

### Concessions

* In Lancaster County--the heart of Amish Country--quality craftsmanship is practically a given/run of the mill. And at CabinPro, our team believes a quality structure is about more than how the boards are placed. (It’s about thoughtful design and experience–-experience building, sure, but also helping our clients through the process of installing a profitable/inspiring rental unit on their property--one where people stay because they feel inspired.)
* In construction, timeline delays happen--supply chain issues, unforseen weather and deliverability mishaps.. Therefore, we can’t in full-faith promise an exact delivery on a custom building. What we can promise, however, is constant communication, keeping you in the loop at every step, and the owner of CabinPro--who loves people, BTW--being just a phonecall away.

### Story Ideas

* It’s true. Our initial designs were awful. We were designing as we went and the products turned out like you might imagine–-a total mess. So we partnered with an experienced designer, took ideas from our clients, talked to park owners, and turned all that into something incredible--and now offer custom builds (thoughtfully designed down to the floor nails) for the look and feel you’re trying to create. Use word design JOURNEY.
* RVIA certification--what that means

### Customer Experience (Tone/Voice)

* Clean and Clear (No Guesswork)
* “Wow, that was easy.”
* Personal (checks in with clients, asks about stay)


### Words to Use

* Guests (for investors’ customers)
