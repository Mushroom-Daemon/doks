THERE IS MORE CRAP IN ONE NOTE

Always talk about your customer's problems. It attracts them to you more--it deepens their interest in the story you're telling.

The only reason they reach out to you is because they have a problem. Define the problem so clearly that when they face that issue, they go to you.

Again: always talk about your customers' problems. How often do you do it? Do it more.

Here's an example: carmax solves a need--they get you a car. but they never talk about it. they talk about how they're not used car salesmen. what you see iswhat you pay. no commissions. quality certs and inspections to make sure every car is reliable.

In other words, they never talk about needing a car. They focus on alleviating the internal pains associated with buying one.

"Readers want to fret."

People are motivated to solve internal problems--even if you fabricate them. I didn't have a real problem with telling time. I had ways of telling time. I created a problem and resolved it with a watch I made a part of my story.

The BUYING resolves the internal pressure. The dissonance.

this is just a great bit of copy

kind of works as a one-liner


swipes… (probably include later in writing copy bits)

  • "Money isn't everything, but when you and your partner aren't on the same page, it can be a major source of stress. Managing money should make you feel more connected, not less." (nails problem on all three levels, promises the main benefit)
  • "Pets deserve to eat healthy, too" (philo)
  • "Nice guys shouldn’t finish last" (philo)
  • "Being an entrepreneur wasn't supposed to feel like this" (philo)
  • But if you have [problem product solves] you'll never [main benefit].

The reason it's important Tommy Boy saves the company is because he's honest, has integrity, and works hard, vs. the deceptive, greedy, trickerous people trying to take him down.

When Luke shoots thre thing into the shaft, he destroys the Death Star [external], proves he's a Jedi [internal], and good triumphs over evil [philo]. That's your CTA.

The One-Liner should this answer the question "what do you do?"

This is really a misnomer. Typically, these one-liners have two sentences. Which in my mind makes it a two-liner. But hey, who's counting.

Instead, I like to call them "Nailing the Problem."

this can be used as the value section of a website.

Hey, I know we all want this. But this damn external problem is getting in the way and that makes us feel internal problem---and that's plain wrong.

We get it. And we've helped people. And here's how. Here's what you need to do and why. It could be bad if you don't… but it could be amazing if you do. Let's do this.
