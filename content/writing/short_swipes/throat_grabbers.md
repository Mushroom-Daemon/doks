The challenge for all kickass copywriters is the same: getting the ready to read your copy.

In the subject line and preheader, you have at most maybe 65 characters (10 or 15 words) to grab your reader by the throat and not let go until the message is clicked on.


The following headlines are great for email subject and preview lines, headlines for your ad, bolded text, bullet points, you name it. I've seen them on the backs (and front) of books and mailers. Why? Because they work.

I've heard these called "fascinations," "clickbait," and copy that's like a car wreck (you know you shouldn't look but you can't help yourself.) The term I like is "throat grabbers"&mdash;headlines that grab the reader by the through and don't let go until they click or read on.

Check out the following examples. The reason why they work is because they promise a benefit and pique curiosity. They do this by *concealing* the information, teasing the benefit and forcing the reader to dig deeper into the copy.

The keys to great throat grabbers (in my most humble opinion) is this:

1. Method writing: *Be* the reader. The survivor of a heart attack. The terminally ill. The busy mom who can't make it to the gym.
2. Make value accessible with a single action (a click, like, opening an envelope, flipping to a page)
3. Conjure curiosity by teasing value and embellishing the benefit

Learn how to write hooks

Great hooks is what separates:
• The CWs charging 15-25k+royalties...
• And those charging 3-5k for a project.

Not all hooks are created equal tho
Let's talk hooks ⤵️

First, what exactly is a hook?

It's that first line that grabs attention...

where the reader makes a snap judgment:

Keep reading or...

Scroll away?

A hook has three elements:
• Benefit
• Emotion
• Curiosity

Benefit is the PROMISE.

Everybody on the planet is asking: WIIFM? (What's in it for me?) What are you promising them?

EMOTION triggers your market. It pushes their buttons. Make sure you use the right ones!

Finally, CURIOSITY, the element of surprise

It inspires, amazes, shocks, confuses by creating a "gap in knowledge"; a tease

Let's look at some hooks:

1/ NUMBER HOOKS

• 7 ways to ___
• The # 1 mistake beginner ____ make
• 3 ____ every ____ needs to ____
• Top 10 ____ you need to see now
• The 5-Step system I use to _____

These are basic, reliable hooks. The number creates the curiosity.

2/ WITHOUT HOOKS

How to get [BENEFIT] without [OBJECTION(s)]

e.g. How to lose weight w/o dieting or exercising
e.g. How to make money w/o working or investing
e.g. How to find true love w/o apps, dates, or drama

Make sure you nail the objections. The w/o creates the curiosity.



4/ GIMMICK HOOKS

[WEIRD OBJECT] creates [BENEFIT]

e.g. Why drinking beer can build muscle
e.g. How salt can help heart health
e.g. Eat ice cream to lose weight

The "weird thing" creates curiosity here. Better if they defy convention. Which brings us to...

5/ INCONGRUOUS JUXTAPOSITIONS

Coined by my mentor John Carlton and dissected by me...

These are hooks that are "woven" in with the actual product's solution or mechanism.

These aren't gimmicky attention-grabbers.

Incongruous juxtapositions are hooks that... have a "reveal" later that makes you go: OMG, I didn't see that coming.

I'll share the headline from Carlton's most famous ad:

Amazing Secret Discovered By One-Legged Golfer Adds 50 Yards To Your Drives Eliminates Hooks
and Slices… And Can Slash Up To 10 Strokes From You’re Game Almost Overnight!

Right away, you think:

What!? But how? How can a one-legged man pull off such an amazing feat?

There's confusion, amazement, admiration, and a strong desire to get those results.

That's cool.

But y'know what's really cool?

Later in the ad, the "reveal" is that...

This guy golfs better than most people because... he understands "balance" in a way that only a one-legged man would

Did you get that? Do you see the cleverness?

The hook is baked into the core mechanism of the product!
