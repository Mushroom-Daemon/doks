The challenge for all kickass copywriters is the same: getting the ready to read your copy.

In the subject line and preheader, you have at most maybe 65 characters (10 or 15 words) to grab your reader by the throat and not let go until the message is clicked on.


The following headlines are great for email subject and preview lines, headlines for your ad, bolded text, bullet points, you name it. I've seen them on the backs (and front) of books and mailers. Why? Because they work.

I've heard these called "fascinations," "clickbait," and copy that's like a car wreck (you know you shouldn't look but you can't help yourself.) The term I like is "throat grabbers"&mdash;headlines that grab the reader by the through and don't let go until they click or read on.

Check out the following examples. The reason why they work is because they promise a benefit and pique curiosity. They do this by *concealing* the information, teasing the benefit and forcing the reader to dig deeper into the copy.

The keys to great throat grabbers (in my most humble opinion) is this:

1. Method writing: *Be* the reader. The survivor of a heart attack. The terminally ill. The busy mom who can't make it to the gym.
2. Make value accessible with a single action (a click, like, opening an envelope, flipping to a page)
3. Conjure curiosity by teasing value and embellishing the benefit

#### The Swipes

Learn how to write hooks

A hook has three elements:
• Benefit
• Emotion
• Curiosity

Benefit is the PROMISE.

Everybody on the planet is asking: WIIFM? (What's in it for me?) What are you promising them?

EMOTION triggers your market. It pushes their buttons. Make sure you use the right ones!

Finally, CURIOSITY, the element of surprise

It inspires, amazes, shocks, confuses by creating a "gap in knowledge"; a tease

Let's look at some hooks:

**NUMBER HOOKS**

* 7 ways to ___
* *The # 1 mistake beginner ____ make
* 3 ____ every ____ needs to ____
* The 5-Step system I use to _____

These are basic, reliable hooks. The number creates the curiosity.
