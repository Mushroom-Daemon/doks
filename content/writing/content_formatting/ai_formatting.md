At the time of writing this, the trajectory of AI is unkown. However, the following tips will help you write articles that are informative and helpful to people first. And that's a win.

Just as a writer. Not a developer.

Formatting your info like this makes it, supposedly, easier for

quality content wins

helpful, accurate still wins

helpful content from a trusted source

* Authority matters (how can you build authority?)
	* you want to be mentioned
	*
* E-E-A-T = experience, expertise, authoritativeness, trustworthiness
* user intent is key
* you want to be quotable
* get people to link to you
* create supporting content
* keywords in headings
* BACKLINKS
* conversational content; be specific "2 week thailand itinerary for couples"
* FAQ, how-to, and review schemas for AI parsing (add schemas?)
* answer directly (lead with clear recommendations, then elaborate)
* mix and match content types
* USE ORIGINAL DATA
* use expert quotes and credentials
* cite other statistics and sources
* question-based headers
* 40-60 word direct answers
* self-contained chunks
* FAQ sections
* schema markup everywhere
* natural language everywhere/natural language headers
* author credentials (how?)
* query-matching headers***
* data-rich content (use stats and quotes.... this is basic persuasion stuff)

bottom line: it should be as helpful as possible to *people*; scannable, self-contained, reads well aloud

* write questions as a user would ask

use semantic cues. this is just decent writing. don't be a robot. READ IT ALOUD.

* tell your brand's story!

Brand VOICE is important. Make it sound like it's all coming from the same place.

try alsoasked.com

get real questions from real people that really know!
