## Creating a Sense of Urgency
A while back I had this girlfriend. We had a lot of fun, but she was hesitant to commit to me. No matter what I tried, she just wouldn't become "official."

Then, there was another time&mdash;with another girlfriend&mdash;and *I* was the one having a hard time committing to *her*. I just couldn't help but wonder what else was out there...

Both relationships eventually led to committment. But something needed to happen first. He's what tipped the scales...

A breakup.

And both times the dumper came crawling back.

Humans are funny. We sometimes don't appreciate what we have. But, man, when there's a threat of it being taken away, we sure want to hold on tight. The time to shit or get off the pot is over, and with no bathroom in sight, we realize we've got to shit *real bad*.

A feeling of scarcity is a powerful motivatorâ€”one you're wise to exploit in every piece of copy you write. I'll tell you why.

Because even after the perfect pitch, an unbelievable offer, people won't take action. They'll want to think it over. They'll hem and haw. They'll move on. So you have to find a way to spur them into action. Otherwise...

They *need* to be tipped over the edge

They'll probably find themselves another boyfriend or girlfriend...

Stoke the fire with the fear of loss. Give your prospects a reason to buy *now*. Do it every time. The possibilities for doing so are limited only by your imagination.

Here are a few examples to get you started.

## Swipes

more scarcity stuff:

"I screwed up, the price is supposed yto be 69 bucks, not 49, but if you respodnd before Friday, you can have it for 49."

If you take something people want, and suddenly lower the price, they will buy it.

This is specific scarcity...

I have something for sale. It normally costs $750K. I'll sell it now for $150K. (Value/Greed) Why? (Tell them why.) Because someone left a huge deposit and bailed. It's the missing person sale. You cover the rest and we're all good here. (Scarcity---once only. Greed.)
