AKA, sometimes, be   vague.

I recently took a trip to southern California. While there, my girlfriend and I were visiting some friends and bopping around the Los Angeles area. I had lived there for about nine years, and she had some friends in town, as well.

While there, we borrowed a car from a close friend of hers sister. It was an old Corolla and I loved driving it, and drove it as if it were my own. We picked up the car the evening we arrived and then drove it to the apartment where we would be staying.

The next morning, we had plans to hangout with a friend of mine who lived close by. He offered to come pick us up and take us wherever we'd like to go. I was wearing a puffer coat and the pockets were stuffed to the gills with multiple key sets, trash from reciepts and gum wrappers, my wallet, etc. I was tired of carrying all that crap around and decided to streamline my pocket contents before we took off.

Wanting to separate the borrowed keys from all the garbage in my pockets, I set those on top of the car. Then, I threw some garbage in a nearby trashcan, put my phone and wallet in my backpack and then got into the passenger seat. All set to go, we took off for his home about (a mile and a half away.)

We chilled awhile at his house, caught up, he got to know my girlfriend, and then I suggested we head up the freeway to a neighboring town. We needed groceries and this buddy of mine used to head up that way together to hang. About halfway up the freeway, I had an urge to make sure I had all my belongings. Phone, keys, wallet, the trifecta. Phone, check. Wallet, check. Borrowed car keys...

I dug around in my bag, in my pockets, around me in the car, staving off panic [uplay emotion] and then my buddy said it. "You know what, I saw you put them... "

Where are the keys?

Imagine I told you that same story, but instead it went like this.

I put the keys on top of the car and left them there and we drove away and i didn't realize they were missing until later.

Doesn't have quite the same punch, eh?

The more the mind works to reach a successful conclusion, the more positive, enjoyable, or stimulating the experience.

Working hard creates a great deal of personal satisfaction. Me and the ET4T, for example.

What do you want to tell the reader? *Make that a conclusion they come to own their own*.

"The Seiko chronograph alarm sells for $300. The watch costs jewelers $150. And jewelers love the item, not only because of the excellent reputation of the Seiko brand,but because it's probably America's best selling new expensive digital watch. And Seiko can't supply enough of them to their dealers."

^ what isn't being said here?

Don't spoon feed it. Let people be smart.

If you are trying to present a *conclusion* don't spell it out. Let people come to it on their own.
