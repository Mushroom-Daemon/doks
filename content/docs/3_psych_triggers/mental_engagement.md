##### Sometimes, it pays to be vague.

### Heading for Formatting

I recently took a trip to southern California. My girlfriend and both had friends in the area and we spent a week bopping around Los Angeles.

If you're familiar with LA, you probably know you need a car to get around. Luckily, we were able to borrow one from a friend of hers (my girlfriend's). It was a 2003 Toyota Corrola (we took the trip in 2025). I loved it. It reminded me of the piece of shit I used to cruise down the freeways on (but this one had power windows and an automatic transmission) and drove it as if it were my own.

We picked up the car on the evening of our arrival. The next morning, however, we didn't need the car as a friend of mine was coming to pick us up. That turned out to be a problem.

When he arrived, I was wearing a puffer coat. (It was the morning in socal, afterall). My pockets were stuffed to the gills with trash, keys, my wallet... all sorts of crap. I decided to clean them out before we left.

I set the car keys on top of the car and then threw away all the garbage I had been carring around in a nearby trashcan. Then, I put my phone and wallet into my backpack and got in the car. We were off.

My buddy lived about a mile and a half away in northwest Pasadena. After chilling at his house awhile catching up on the local scene, I asked if we could make a run to the grocery store a bit up the 210 freeway in La Canada. Him and I used to hangout at a coffee shop up there, and I thought it would be fun. We also needed some food.

About halfway up the freeway, I felt an urge to check for my belongings. Phone, keys, wallet: the trifecta. I dug into my backpack and there was my phone, right in the top pocket. I dug around a little more and put my hand on my wallet. And then dug around some more and some more and some more and started to panic. I couldn't find the car keys.

Then my buddy said:

"You know what, I saw you put them... "

### Another Heading of Sorts

If you've been paying attention, I imagine you know where I left the keys. If not, well, go back and try again. I'll reveal what happened to those keys in a later lesson, but for now, imagine I told you the same story, but instead a key scene (*ahem*) went something like this: (**Spoiler Alert**)

*"Emptying out my pockets, I put the keys on top of the car and left them there when we drove away. I didn't realize they were missing until later."*

Doesn't have quite the same punch, eh? Here's why.

As a reader, when you come to a conclusion on your own, it feels good. Reaching that successful conclusion on your own gives you a little boost. You're experiencing the story in a different&mdash;more engaging&mdash;way.

See if you can use this strategy to make your copy that much more kickass. Let me explain how.

Ask yourself what you want to tell your reader. Then, see if you can find a way to have them come to that conclusion *on their own*. Man oh man does it work. And man, oh man, is it one of my most favorite things to do.

Here's an example from an ad written by Joe Sugarman.

> *"The Seiko chronograph alarm sells for $300. The watch costs jewelers $150. And jewelers love the item, not only because of the excellent reputation of the Seiko brand, but because it's probably America's best selling new expensive digital watch. And Seiko can't supply enough of them to their dealers."*

Why do the jewelers *really* love the watch? See how smart you are?

### Action Items

Bottom line: let people be smart. Be vague sometimes, letting your reader come to the conclusion you want by their own intellegince. They'll lap that shit up. And like you&mdash;and your kickass copy&mdash;all the better for it.
