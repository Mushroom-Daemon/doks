My ex-wife used to watch this chick on YouTube.

My story here is to talk about the BTB folks. They'd call email whatever. Happy trumpeting. We developed community. It was easy to sell to those folks and they referred their friends. Maybe I should start saying this to my students.

Also, if you want something, be around. Make yourself familiar to the people who can get you what you want.

Write something and post it and make it clear who wrote it.

Gave the officer's children gum and said "Don't tell anybody Mr. Sugarman gave you this fum. That's Mr. Sugarman. remember, Mr. Sugarman did not give you this gum." every day.

We like what we know. This is branding. It's also linking. \\

Your format
Your logo
Your company name
Selling environment
Familiar phrases
"Hello my trumpet-playing friends"
"My strong, strong friends"
"When you do, you're in for a treat!"
"Happy trumpeting"
"All good wishes and (always!) higher response"
7 is the most common integer. Use it in a title. (Seven habits of Highly Effectie People, Seven Way to Improve Your Relationship, Seven Spiritual Laws of Success...)
Familiar words. Like "Bible."
Beginner's Trumpet Bible.
Ask people to randomly choose a number or color or piece of furniture or whatever... how can you use that?
If you want something, BE AROUND.

Repetition, repetition, repetition.

Find ways to make people comfortable with your product or service.

Drive the shit home over and over and over again.

Don't tire of your ads&mdash;let the public do that.

Sales are the only metric.

The contrast of seeing somebody with whom you are familiar in a completely foreign setting creates a strong attraction. (Jonestown folks in the jungle. Travel with your woman.)
