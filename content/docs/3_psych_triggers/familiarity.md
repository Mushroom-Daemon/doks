My ex-wife used to watch this chick on YouTube. Megsquats has been forever emblazoned in my memory.

And it's not just because she's pretty and I liked her smile. Oh no, her psychological tactic was far more negarious. She used to start every video by saying the same thing:

"Hello my strong, strong friends."

And I will never forget it.

The thing is, we like what we know. When we're familiar with something&mdash;a neighborhood, an operating system, an old beater automobile&mdash;we just like it. If you want to write kickass copy that persuades, people liking you is going to make a big difference.

I actually stole megsquats into idea for a newsletter and video series I used to put out about trumpeting. I opened every letter and video by saying (or writing) "Hello my trumpet playing friends," and closed each with the saying "Happy trumpeting!" And it worked.

People loved it. They would respond to me all the time and sign their emails with "Happy Trumpeting!" We developed a community. And those folks that got involved would buy my courses and refer their friends.

The bottom line here is *being known*. Joe Sugarman, the copywriter who I learned many of these psychological triggers from served some time in the military. He wanted to be known&mdash;and liked&mdash;among the commanding officers. To achieve this, he gave their children bubble gum every day and said...

*"Don't tell anybody Mr. Sugarman gave you this gum. That's Mr. Sugarman. remember, Mr. Sugarman did not give you this gum."*

In other words, you want to be known, be liked, a familiar face in the crowd. It'll make folks comfortable with you&mdash;and all that more interested in what you have to say.

Here are a few ways you can do that in your kickass copy. What others will you come up with? Once you've found something you like, drive it home over and over and over again.

### Familiarity Ideas

* A familiar design (font choice, format, logo, company name, etc.)
* Familiar phrases
  * "Hello my strong, strong friends" (megsquats)
  * "When you do, you're in for a treat!" (John Rose)
  * "Rooting for you" (Integro)
  * "All good wishes and (always!) higher response" (Gary Bencivegna)
* Familiar words or numbers like "Bible" or "The Seven... "

Write something and post it and make it clear who wrote it.

### Action Item

Ask yourself, is it absolutley clear to the reader where this kickass copy is coming from?
