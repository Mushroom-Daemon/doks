Also it's just about them feeling special. Make them feel special by offering them something only a few get to take advantage of.

Collectibles, limited editions, short production run, *really* expensive, anything to make it unique. Autographs, etc.

This ties into the desire to belong and also scarcity...

Basically, people get to join a special group by pushasing.

Exclusivity *can* lead to growth in value. It doesn't always, but people are into it.

"Only six made. We've been given two and have already sold one."

How can you make your product exclcusive by limiting its availability and making this fact known? how can you show demand and make your product scarce?
