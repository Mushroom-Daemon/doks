(maybe I should intro this as the agreement in the S.B. framework)

After you've explained your offer, many buyers will still be on the fence. Naturally, we all have hesitations or worries and want to make sure we're making a wise choice. This makes part of your job as copywriter taking those worries and obliterating them. You do this with your Satisfaction Conviction.

Naturally, we all have our worries. Your job is to take that worry away.

The Satisfaction Conviction is the late-night television salesman saying "I'm so convinced you'll love this product, I'm going to do something crazy." It's a complete risk-reversal, where you show your clients they have nothing to lose.

Done right, your satisfaction conviction should make your prospects think:

  • Your product or service must truly be phenomenal

 and/or…

  • You (the supplier) are probably going to get taken advantage of

For a great example of a Satisfaction Conviction, check out REI's return policy:

WRITE MY EXAMPLE OF PRECISE BUILDER.

What makes this return policy so great is not just its length---a generous year long return window (more on that in a minute), but that the great can be returned used. They're essentially letting member kick the tires out in the real world for a full year. Try it out. Give it hell. If you're still on the fence after that, bring it back for your money back or a new one.

It addresses the concerns of a camper that they might like the way a bag feels in the store, but what about after 20 miles on the trail? Well, REI is letting them try it out, no holds bar.

they can also get taken advantage of and you can go and get a backpack use it for a year bring it back and get a new backpack use it for a year bring it back in a new backpack… All within the rules of the return policy.

Writing Your Satisfaction Conviction

There are two basic keys to a great Satisfaction Conviction.

  1. Resolve the *actual* concerns of your customers
  2. Then, if needed, go one step above and beyond

The first step requires understanding the worries of your customers. What are the most common hesitations or concerns you hear about your product? And don't just assume it's always about money.  they worried about losing money? A failing product? Difficulty using your product or getting it serviced?

If I go to the grocery store or a box of crackers, I might be worried I don't like the taste, or they're stale. Tell me I can bring them back if think they suck and I'm happy.

But what if I'm more concerned with… Some other example… For example, you might be worried the crackers you buy at the grocery store taste bad, or are stale. The money you spend on software might be wasted if you can't figure out how to use it.

Don't guess---ask.

A Note on Money-Back Trials and Warranties

(A note on trial periods: typically, the longer the trial the better, and the less it gets taken advantage of. If you offer a two-week trial period, the customer will likely be thinking of whether or not they actually want the product in that two weeks. Make it longer and they relax. They know they can return it… and then don't.)

If you're unhappy with your BluBlockers, return them anytime you want. No trial period. I'll give you your money back.

THE STEP FURTHER STUFF NOW…

Then, ask yourself what else you can offer beyond a basic resolution of those concerns. You might not even need to make an explicit guarantee. Here are a few good examples.


Consumer Hero (A $5 membership club for buying used electronics at discount prices)


"But what if you never buy from us and your two-year membership expires? Fine. Send us just your membership card and we'll fully refund your five dollars---plus send you interest on your money."


Precise Builder

Try the software 6 months risk-free. If you aren't loving Precise Builder after that, you get your money back. We'll even help you find and set up a better software for your company.


"Beyond Warranty" Guarantees

If you're like me, you're highly skilled at coming up with "yeah, but… " statements. Yeah, but what about after the warranty." "Yeah, but, can I return it if I wear it?" And so forth. (Include something funny about relationships.)

Or, I don't care what it is, I don't want to have to buy a new one every year.

The following examples don't make official guarantees beyond the limited warranty, but they still make (me, anyways) feel better that I'll get plenty of value well past the protected trial period.

Sensor 770 Watch

The Sensor 770 has an unprecedented five-year parts and labor unconditional warranty. Each watch goes through weeks of aging, testing and quality control before assembly and final inspection. Service should never be required, but if it should anytime during the five-year warranty period, we will pick up your Sensor at your door and send you a loaner watch while yours is being repaired–all at our expense.

(I like the use of service never being required. And, they replace the watch while yours is being repaired, if needed. They said all this twice in the same print ad.)

We have selected the Sensor as the most advanced American-made, solid-state timepiece ever produced. And we put our company and its full resources behind that selection. JS&A will unconditionally guarantee the Sensor–even the battery–for five years. We’ll even send you a loaner watch to use while your watch is being repaired should it ever require repair.

Craig Mark II

Also sold by JS&A, the Craig Mark II was a … The copy demonstrates authority, quality, and that the



(I like this one because the copy shows the product is built to well outlast the warranty period. Also, lets people know that it's easy to get serviced as needed.)

Farmco

Farmco offers a seven year warranty on their cattle and horse feeders. But the copy goes on to show the products are built to last decades. It also establishes authority.

  7-Year Product Warranty for Farmers
  The Farmco team built our first feeders back in the 1970s—right here on the family farm. So we know firsthand what it takes for equipment to hold up to real farming.
  And we stand behind that claim—with no-cost replacements and repairs on defective feeders and parts for a full seven years after purchase. But you won’t need it.
  Because our feeders are built to last decades in the field. And with normal farm-tough use and some light maintenance, you’ll be saving time, money and labor for years to come.
