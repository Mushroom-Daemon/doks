##### No copy is kickass without this. (It can double response.)

### Headline

Here's the deal. Even after the perfect pitch, readers may still have hesitations. Why? Because it's natural to worry about whether or not you're making the right choice (relationships, amirite?). So to make you copy that much more kickass, you need to obliterate that worry. You do that with your satisfaction conviction.

The Satisfaction Conviction is the written version of a late-night television salesman saying "I'm so *convinced* you'll love this product, I'm going to do something *CRAZY*." It's a complete risk-reversal, where you show your clients, without the shadow of a doubt, they have nothing to lose. Done right, your satisfaction conviction should make your prospects think:

* Your product or service must truly be phenomenal

and/or...

* You (the offerer) are going to get ripped off

Here's an example from outdoor retailer, REI.

### Example 1: REI

> **100% Satisfaction Guarantee**
>
> *We stand behind everything we sell. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can return it for a replacement or refund&mdash;with a few exceptions&mdash;within one (1) year of the purchase date if you are an REI Co-op Member or within 90 days of your purchase if you are not a member.*

What makes this return policy so great is not just its length&mdash;a generous year long return window, but that the great can be returned *used*. Try the gear for a full year. Give it hell. Don't love it after that, bring it back.

### Two Keys to a Great Satisfaction Conviction

There are two keys to a great Satisfaction Conviction.

  1. Resolve the *actual* concerns of your customers
  2. Go a step above and beyond resolving those concerns

**Key #1: Resolving Hesitations**

The first key may be the most important. It requires understanding the worries of your customers&mdash;their most common hesitations or concerns. And don't assume it's always money.

... Ask them!

**Key #2: Going Above and Beyond**

Once you've resolved the concerns of your prospect, it's time to take it a step further. Here are a few good examples that cover all those bases.

### Example 2: Precise Builder

Precise Builder is an estimating and project management software for exterior contractors. One of the main hesitations is onboarding (i.e. learning the software). Also note how we go above and beyond.

> *Learning a new software takes time and effort&mdash;and Precise Builder is no different. Let our team walk with you until your crews are completely comfortable. If after six months Precise Builder hasn’t become one of the most valuable tools at your company, we’ll give you your money back&mdash;and help you find a different software.*

### Example 3: Consumer Hero

Consumer Hero was a $5 membership club for buying refurbished electronics at discount prices. The concern for joinging their club would be paying the five dollars and never buying. Also note the more-than-your-money-back guarantee. The interest on $5 would be negligible, but it does the trick!

> *"But what if you never buy from us and your two-year membership expires? Fine. Send us just your membership card and we'll fully refund your five dollars---plus send you interest on your money."*

### Example 4: Farmco

Farmco is a manufacturer of horse and cattle feeders in Ronks, PA. They offer a limited 7-year warranty but then suggest (no official guarantee) that the products last decades. This helps to alleviate concerns after the warranty period (which is actually quite long). The copy also establishes authority.

  > **7-Year Product Warranty for Farmers**
  >
  > *The Farmco team built our first feeders back in the 1970s—right here on the family farm. So we know firsthand what it takes for equipment to hold up to real farming.*
  >
  > *And we stand behind that claim—with no-cost replacements and repairs on defective feeders and parts for a full seven years after purchase. But you won’t need it.*
  >
  > *Because our feeders are built to last decades in the field. And with normal farm-tough use and some light maintenance, you’ll be saving time, money and labor for years to come.*

### A Note on Trials and Warranties

Research shows the longer the trial period, the greater conversions and the less it gets taken advantage of. Offer a two-week trial period and the customer will likely be thinking of whether or not they actually want the product during that two weeks. Make it longer and they relax, knowing they can return it later if need be... only to never do it.

### Example 5: BluBlockers

> *If you're unhappy with your BluBlockers, return them anytime you want. No trial period. I'll give you your money back.*

### Action Items

What are your customer's concerns or hesitations about doing business with you?

What can you offer above and beyond a basic money-back guarantee?
