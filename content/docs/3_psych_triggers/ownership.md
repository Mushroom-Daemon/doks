##### Some kickass kind of copy thing to say

### Headline

* When selling in person, you have a kind of advantage.
* you can try the boots on
* in copy, you've got just your words and the reader's imagination
* they can't kick the tires, try on the boots, or kiss their mail-order bride
* the *goal* is to *feel* and *see* how using your product is going to make their lives better/help them see themselves the way they want to be seen (ID)




So you've got to help them feel those feels. To do that, involve all the senses, get them to imagine touching, using, smelling, hearing your product. See through your eyes, touch through your hands, smell through your nose or feel your feelings.

In print, spell out how they'll use the product in a practical way. Hypnotize them. carry them through the imagery of ownership, of how they'll use the product.

Loosen the tongue and slide on your boots, sinch the laces down and quickly thread them through the speed hooks (faster and faster the more you wear your boots). The leather softens and molds to your feet, for a fit that's all yours and comfortable all day long&mdash;for years to come.

Don't sell them a patio. Sell them the feel of cool stone under their feet on a summer's evening.

Have them take a stroll. Have them easily slip on and go for a run in their new shoes, light as air and soft on the ground.







Talk to them as if they already own the product. The more vividily they can see that, the more ready they'll be to make that vision of themselves a reality. Make them believe they are experiencing those things. Fill the vacuum of their mind with the image of what they will be enjoying with your product.

The more you get them involved in that feeling of ownership, the closer you are to a sale.

This comes down to them beeing able to *see* what you write. the puppies romping and playing bit.
