Reciprocity... This might go somewhere else. It ties into guilt.

Give them something.

* Entertainment
* Repeat mailings
* Repeat lumpy mailings

"In reply I want you to know who I am."

Repetition creates guilt. You'll often get so much more to alleviate their guilt.

The key story. My guilt for breaking the key... a fix that did not even need to happen. I sould have paid $200 to get over it. WE WANT TO RESOLVE DISCOMFORT. It's why we end relationships, too.

what did someone give me that created a sense of obligation? Tell that story. Then ask them to tell theirs?

What can you provide that costs very little but leaves people feeling indebted to you? What will make them want to buy?
