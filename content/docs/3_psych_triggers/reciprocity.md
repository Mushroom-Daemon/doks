##### This is a intro sentence... but does it make the copy that much more kickass? does it TEASE or create URGENCY? If not, don't use it.

### The Story Header

Curious what happened to those keys I borrowed in the last lesson? Here, I'll tell you.

So we were half a mile up the freeway when my buddy reminded me I sat the keys on the top of the car before we left. I was staving off panic as we drove turned around and headed toward our starting point. "We'll find 'em," he said.

I was watching to road like a hawk. We drove through the budy streets of Pasadena and I couldn't take my eyes off the other side of the road. Then, when we were about a mile from where we had started in the morning, I saw them.

The keys were attached to a large lanyard which made them easier to spot. He pulled a U-turn in the middle of the road and parked next to the curb. I ran out and got the keys.

They had clearly been run over. Probably multiple times. The key rings were mangled, but the keys themselves seemed to be in fine shape. However, the key fob (electronic door opener... I learned what this was called on after this debacle) had broken off and just a piece of broken plastic remained.

I didn't realize this until we had left *again*, but when my girlfriend asked if there had been a key fob I realized "fuck. yes. turn around."

By some miracle the key fob survived. It looked like it had maybe broken off on impact and then skid into the center of the lane where it avoided being crushed by car tires. *And it worked*. The only issue was that it had broken off of the key ring.

I felt like one lucky son of a bitch, let me tell you that, but still felt terrible for fucking up the key fob. Here's this person, whom I did not know personally, and she lets us borrow her car for a week and within 24 hours I fuck her keys up. I felt terrible.

I started looking into key fob replacements. A new key fob from a dealer is *not* cheap. The key and programming looked to run about $200. Ultimately, I ended up paying $12 at autozone for a new case I put the electronics into. But I am here to tell you that I would have gladly paid $200 *or more* simply to alleviate my guilt. I felt terrible.

### Guilt is a Powerful Motivator

Now, you probably won't be able to manufactur a scenario quite like the one above in print (nor necessarily should you). But, you *can* instill a sense of guilt in your reader, and it might not be a bad idea. How do you do that? Like this.

Give them something.

When poeple receive gifts, they can feel an intense desire to reciprocate in some way.

(*Side note: When I went through the new bike debacle LINK, I felt indebted to the company. I signed up for a class they offered, purchased a few more items* and *donated an unused bike. I can't say it made the staff like me anymore, but hey, what can you do.*)

Here are a few things you can give your prospects with your kickass copy:

* Information
* Entertainment
* Repeat mailings
* Repeat lumpy mailings (mailings with small gifts inside)

In reply, you really only want one thing: for them to know you.

### Action Items

What can you provide your reader that costs very little to you but leaves them feeling the need to "get you back"? What will make them want to buy?
