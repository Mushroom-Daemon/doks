##### Something about something the opposite of specificity

### And here's my headline

In another lesson, we talk about using specificity to make your copy more kickass. But what if you *can't* make specific claims? In that case, do this.

Play on hope.

All sorts of products are sold on hope. Vitamins, organic foods, personal training, dating apps, you name it.

To sell these products effectively, you want to imply the *possibility* of using your product or service. Here are a few ways you can play on that hope.

* Allude to what you product is used for without making claims to specific outcomes (a hair-volumizing shampoo, for instance)
* Show testimonials of customers saying "wow, it really worked for me!"
* Ramp up believability with credibility

Let me give you an example from my personal life.

Recently, I was having a period of time where I was self-conscious about the overall rigor of my erections.

I did a little research and found something interesting on the internet. It seemed there was a group of folks talking about this certain exercise program for your cardiovascular system. In particular, it worked on the veins and arteries in your penis.

To be honest, it kind of weirded me out at first. I won't go into the exercise in detail here (you're welcome), but it just kind of skeezed me out. However, the commenters were sharing all sorts of stuff like...

"It works." "Yup, it works." "I'm in my 40s and this is the hardest I've been in my life." That social proof really helped. And this too...

The guy who "invented" the exercise was going on and on about the cardiovascular makeup of the male member. He had scientific drawings of the cross section of a fallace and used scientific terminology and explanations of the systems the exercise affected. That gave him credibility. And you know what.

I bought in.

And it worked.

### Action Items

What do people hope for when they buy your product? A life partner? A few strokes off their golf game? A harder cock? Once you've nailed it down, ramp that shit up in your kickass copy.
