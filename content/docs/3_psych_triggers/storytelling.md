From birth, we are primed for stories.

Try this: walk into a room, say "It sure is nice outside." See how many people look at you. Walk in another room and say "I have a story." Compare.

People love stories. We're primed for them, seemingly, from birth. Why that is, I don't know or really care, because the bottom line is that it's true. Stories hold people's attention. Folks perk up when they know one is coming.

And that's good for you to know, because the #1 your reader has to do is *read your copy*. That's what comes first. No sales until that happens.

What stories can you tell? Then, tell them it's coming.

What is the story of how you discovered the product? (blublockers)

What is the story of what you do or what you did?

How did you discover this new development?

Are there any stories about you that are of interest?

Storytelling is an art form and you get better as you go. A good place to start is just knowing that stories sell. See how many you can come up with and get writing!

tell stories that don't even relate to your product. Put this on the "checklist."
