Bring up the negative features first.

What do people complain about?

If something about a product sucks: it's ugly, cheap, whatever, bring that up in the copy first. Then, dismiss those concerns later with the other virtues of the product.

"The only negative feature of this house may appear to e the busy street facing the back yard."

… Then, show how it's a positive.

You can transform those problems into major benefits.

By dong this, you come across as honest and trustworthy. It lowers defenses and opens them up to the real benefits of your product or service.

  • :To make it easy, we provide you with the tools. In our tests, it only took five minutes for somebody with very little mechanical skill to put it together."

Try It:

List all objections on one side of a piece of paper. then, how can you resolve those and turn them into opportunities? In your copy, only raise serious concerns--not the little stuff.

Resolve the objections by showing how they are minor. Or how a certain kind of person would benefit from that. Or by overshadowing it with the product's other good features.
