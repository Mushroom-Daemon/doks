A great many have the idea that the ability to remember a large number of faces, factsand figures is a gift&mdash;that you have to come by it naturally. Nothing could be further from the truth. Any man, woman, or child of average intelligence can easilyt and quickly acquire acquire acquire a dependable memory. (then there's the STORY of the EXPERT that started as a loser nobody and now AMAZING! Doing IMPOSSIBLE things! Before he was NOTHING and NO ONE.)

Mr. Roth's system which he has developed through years of study (credibility/authority), and which he has taught in class to hundreds of business men and others throughout the country and in person (authority/even you can) is so easy (peope love that) that a twelve year old child can learn it (not a monkey, but a kid... a *kid*), and it is more real fun than any game you play solely for pleasure (people love that, too).

The head-to-toe that the guy taught his entire film crew. That was a good one. I remember that shit. Watch his ads.
