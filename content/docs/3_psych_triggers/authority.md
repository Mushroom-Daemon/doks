A little while back I decided I wanted to buy myself a bike. After poking around online, I found a model I liked and went to a local shop to see if they could order for me.

When I got to the shop, I was excited to find they had a few in stock. I rode one around for a bit and found it great fun. They didn't have the color I wanted, so the shop placed an order for me online.

When the bike finally arrived&mdash;after the manufacturer first sent the wrong one&mdash;I excitedly rode it home. However, in riding it around the neighborhood, I couldn't help but feel a little buyer's remorse.

I felt like the frame was the wrong size for me. They had two sizes in the shop&mdash;the size I had ordered and a larger one&mdash;and this felt the best of the two. However, I was feeling like an even smaller size would suit me and was kicking myself for not having thought of that sooner.

I went back and forth for awhile and didn't know what to do. I didn't want to be a burden to the shop any longer (they had already put up with me going back and forth while making the initial decision) but I also didn't want to regret my decision. I was stressed. (worried I made the wrong choice. I couldn't get it out of my head for a week.) Until someone set me straight.

It was the mailman. He saw me whip around the corner on my new wheels and was eager to talk shop. He admired the frame, the wheel size, the build and colorway... And in the process demonstrated his deep interest and authority on the subject of bikes.

I told him I was self-conscious about the size choice. He asked if it was because I thought it was too big, which I did. He then said to me that while I would probably get used to the bike, he believes that everyone should *love* their bike. His opinion was that I should go through the hassle of returning it and getting a new one. So I did.

His knowledge and strong opinion on the matter helped me make a tough decision with confidence. That reassurance was priceless, and now I have a bike I love. Your job as kickass copywriter is to provide that reassurance.

That means being the knowledgeable friend. *Knowing what you're talking about*. Being the knowledgeable friend who wants you to appreciate the money you've spent. This means establishing yourself as an *authority*. Here are a few ways how.

### Questions to Ask
> * Do you follow any specific jurisdictions or rules?
> * How long have you been in your field?
>   * *After 30 years, we know gutters*
>   * *You might only do this once in your life&mdash;we do it everyday*
> * Is there anything you're the biggest at? The smartest? Most well-equipped? First? Fastest growing? Hardest working?
>   * *The Most Crowdfunded App in Kickstarter's History*
>   * *Motors and Pumps: Largest supply in Pennsylvania*
>   * *Largest Selection of Used Legos in America*
> * What makes you an expert in your field?
>   * *How to use a strap-on, according to queer sex experts*
> * Who uses this product?

### Additional Ideas
> * Where you post your ads/content can display authority
> * The city your business is in (NYC publisher, Hollywood studio musician, Paris perfumes, Brooklyn pizzas, pubs in Glasgow... )
> * Your name can create authority (Computer Discount Warehouse)
> * Have you created any popular products (Creator of the... America's #1 selling vibrator)
> * Tell your story in a sentence or two
>   * *"I went bankrupt a long time ago... then I found this... and now I ahve financial peace and you can too."*
>   * *"Using the exact plan you'll learn in this book, I grew my business from four employees working out of a basement to a $15M operation in just six years."*
> * Show the success of your customers
>   * *One of the companies&mdash;cincinnati Microwave&mdash;sent three of their top people to my seminar before it took off and became a $140M company with over $40M in profits.*
> * Include testimonials, case studies, referrals, any kind of numbers
>   * *Most customers save $600 in their first month*
>   * *9/10 customers get the solution they need* without *becoming paying customers*
> * Do you have any awards, press, accolades, businesses you've worked with (show logos)
