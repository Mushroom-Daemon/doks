A little while back I decided I wanted to buy myself a bike. After poking around online, I found a model I liked and went to a local shop to see if they could order for me.

When I got to the shop, I was excited to find they had a few in stock. I rode one around for a bit and found it great fun. They didn't have the color I wanted, so the shop placed an order for me online.

When the bike finally arrived&mdash;after the manufacturer first sent the wrong one&mdash;I excitedly rode it home. However, in riding it around the neighborhood, I couldn't help but feel a little buyer's remorse.

I felt like the frame was the wrong size for me. They had two sizes in the shop&mdash;the size I had ordered and a larger one&mdash;and this felt the best of the two. However, I was feeling like an even smaller size would suit me and was kicking myself for not having thought of that sooner.

I went back and forth for awhile and didn't know what to do. I didn't want to be a burden to the shop any longer (they had already put up with me going back and forth while making the initial decision) but I also didn't want to regret my decision. I was stressed. Until someone set me straight.

It was the mailman. He saw me whip around the corner on my new wheels and was eager to talk shop. He admired the frame, the wheel size, the build and colorway... And in the process demonstrated his deep interest and authority on the subject of bikes.

I told him I was self-conscious about the size choice. He asked if it was because I thought it was too big, which I did. He then said to me that while I would probably get used to the bike, he believes that everyone should *love* their bike. His opinion was that I should go through the hassle of returning it and getting a new one. So I did.

His knowledge and strong opinion on the matter helped me make a tough decision with confidence. That reassurance was priceless, and now I have a bike I love. Your job as kickass copywriter is to provide that reassurance.

That means being the knowledgeable friend. *Knowing what you're talking about*. Being the knowledgeable friend who wants you to appreciate the money you've spent. This means establishing yourself as an *authority*. here are a few ways how.

Questions to Ask Your Clients


this is about the stress and worry of making the wrong choice. louie took that away and gave me confidence. I felt guilt about returning it to the shop after they ordered and built it. I couldn't get it out of my head for a week. Then I bumped into an unlikely ... saw the mailman.
