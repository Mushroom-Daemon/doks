A little while back I decided I wanted to buy myself a bike. After poking around online, I found a model I liked and went to a local shop to see if they could order for me.

When I got to the shop, I was excited to find they actually had a few in stock. I rode one around for a bit and thought it was great fun. The colorway I wanted was sold online&mdash;and I was hoping to take advantage of a Black Friday deal&mdash;and they were totally cool with all that. They'd let me place the order through the shop and then assemble the bike for me when it arrived... Which ended up being kind of a hassle.

For starters, the manufacturer sent the wrong bike.  so they had to pack it back up and return it. Then, the sent the right bike, but I became the problem. For some reason, it felt too big for me. I couldn’t stand over the bike without getting racked, for one. And the whole thing just felt too big. I was going back and forth and back and forth until someone set me straight.

It was my mailman. He saw me whip around the corner on my new wheels and wanted to talk all about it. This guy, Louie, to me, is an expert. He walks something like eight hours a day, and when he isn't on foot, he's riding around town on his road bike or cargo bike. The dude knows and loves bikes, something he made clear while admiring my new whip.

I told him I was self-conscious about the size choice. He asked if it was because I thought it was too big, which I did. I then explained my complaints to him and he said he believes a person should love their bike---that way they'll ride it. And I should go through the hassle of returning it. So I did.

His authority and strong opinion on the matter---just knowing and loving bikes---helped me make a tough decision with confidence. His reassurance made it okay for me to go with what I thought. I took his advice and now I have a bike I love--and his my
mailman's expert validation and reassurance played no small part in that. Your job as copywriter (or business leader or marketer or whoever) is to provide that reassurance.


Be the knowledgeable friend, the neutral third-party that wants you to appreciate the money you've spent. You do this by establishing yourself as an authority---by reassuring them that you can solve their problem.

Questions to Ask Your Clients


this is about the stress and worry of making the wrong choice. louie took that away and gave me confidence. I felt guilt about returning it to the shop after they ordered and built it. I couldn't get it out of my head for a week. Then I bumped into an unlikely ... saw the mailman.
