## Lower the Bar to Entry

Get a yes.

An invitation they can say yes to.

The #1 thing to do is to make it as easy as possible for the prospect to commit to a purchase, regardless of home small that purchase may be. Once they do, they playing field has been changed.

Simple, small, *inline with their needs*.

Then add the upsells. This ties into consistency.

* You want frieds with that?
* Floormats?
* Sell the first for $5, the rest for $19.95 a piece
