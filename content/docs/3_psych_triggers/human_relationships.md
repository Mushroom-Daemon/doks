Buying something is an emotional event.

What has been an emotional event for me? My boots. I love them. And my watch to.

The idea is to create the condition where the prospect is in perfect, harmonic resonance with your copy. Emotions follow the resonant frequency. As does you copy. To get them to feel that way, feel that way. Maybe this goes with "emotion sells."

In fact, every element is a tuning fork. The headline, the picture, the caption, the first sentence all the way to the final offer.

If you want someone to feel love reading your letter, love them.

## The Human Stuff

* Tell stories. (This is already covered)
* Use humor. (Appropriately)
* Write in the first person.
* Show the item held by a hand.
* Show attractive models. (Belonging)
* Use as many positive human elements as you can.
* The bottom line is you want them to pick up and read your ad and feel as if they know you.
