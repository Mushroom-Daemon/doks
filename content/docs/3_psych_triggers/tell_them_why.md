Hey, can I cut you in line? You ask them why. There's resistance. vs Hey, can I cut you in line, my flight leaves in 10 minutes.

Which is more likely to move you?

Why are you offering a special deal?
why are you doing this?
why did you start this company?
if they have questions, those will be in the way of them taking actions. more stuff to think about. they might not believe a good deal, etc.

if you have too low a price, you need to justify it.

REVERSE TESTIMONIAL:
Endorsement Battle
“A famous golf star endorses the lanier. Our unit is endorsed by our president. You’ll save $100 as a result.”
Judge for yourself. That new Olympus micro recorder shown above sells for $150. Its closest competition is a $250 recorder called the Lanier endorsed by a famous gold star.
Fancy Endorsement
The famous gold star is a pilot who personally flies his own Citation jet. The Olympus recorder is endorsed by JS&A’s president who pilots a more cost-efficient single engine Beechcraft Bonanza. The gold star does not endorse the Lanier unit for free. After all, a good portion of his income is derived from endorsing products.
Our president, on the other hand, does not get paid for endorsing products–just for selling them. And his Bonanza is not as expensive the fly as the golf star’s Citation. In fact, our president also drives a Volkswagen Rabbit.
. . . then he went on to show how they sold and shipped more efficiently. The end result? A better product for $100 less.\\e


Explain everything: why does shipping cost that much. be an annoying kid, keep asking why. my shipping, I ship media mail to keep costs low, it takes a week.

I have something for sale. It normally costs $750K. I'll sell it now for $150K. (Value/Greed) Why? (Tell them why.) Because someone left a huge deposit and bailed. It's the missing person sale. You cover the rest and we're all good here. (Scarcity---once only. Greed.)
