What is this about? Trust. If they trust you, you're in.

* this is my favorite persuasive element
* people want to buy from someone they trust---they'll pay a premium for it
* This makes you believable
* That may be the most persuasive element of all
* people are smart. they will have doubts. bring them up in the beginning
* get them thinking... "Can I commit to this?" If they're thinking about your product... GOOD!


### Don't
* hide things (it won't work)
* beat aroundthe bush
* make shit up

### Do
* bring up questions and objections
* answer them in a straight-forward, honest, and credible way
* tell the truth
* be simple, truthful, frank... esp about shortcomings
* total transparency

### Darlings
* And when you get down to it, people will do crazy, crazy shit for something they believe in. Heck, they might even read what you wrote.


### Example 1 Precise Builder

Learning a new software takes time and effort&mdash;and Precise Builder is no different. Let our team walk with you until your crews are completely comfortable. If after six months Precise Builder hasn’t become one of the most valuable tools at your company, we’ll give you your money back&mdash;and help you find a different software.

### Example 2 Smucker Exteriors

There’s no question about it. Upgrading your home is an investment. And truth-be-told, Smucker Exteriors sometimes comes in higher than the competition. There’s a reason for that.

Because we quote fair prices for service that goes above and beyond. And we’re legit&mdash;our employees are vetted at the highest possible level. The guys have integrity.‍

To be fair, you should shop around to make sure you’re getting the best deal. But before you go with the lowballers, ask if they’re PA licensed and fully insured. If not, it could come back to haunt you.

### Example 3 Twin Valley Woodcrafts

It’s true.

There are a lot of cabinet businesses. And when it comes to custom built cabinetry, you have plenty of options.

But with Twin Valley Woodcrafts, you’re choosing a family-owned and operated custom cabinet maker based in the heart of Amish Country&mdash;Lancaster, PA. And we’re still a small company, which is good. Because you get a personal touch and one-on-one relationship with a custom cabinet builder who cares about you and your home.

### Additional Ideas

Include negative reviews and flaws (then, of course, show why the reviews aren't bad at all)
