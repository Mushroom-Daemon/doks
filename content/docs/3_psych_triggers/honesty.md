My favorite element for writing kickass copy.

### headline (for understanding formating)

Here's the bottom line.

People want to buy from (or follow)  someone they trust&mdash;and they'll pay a premium for it.

That makes your job as a kickass copywriter one of developing that trust through the written word. Doing so is not difficult. You just need to do one thing.

Tell the truth.

It may seem simple. It is. But there's slightly more to it than simply telling the truth. You need to bring up your *shortcomings*&mdash;the clients doubts or hesitations. I like to think about it like this.

Telling someone your red flags at the beginning of a relationship. To many, that may feel like a liability, but, two things:

1. the truth always&mdash;*always*&mdash comes out
2. It gets them thinking, "Can I commit to this?" ... And when the other person is thinking about you (or your product), *that's good*.

Bringing up shortcomings in your copy also makes you *belieavble*&mdash;perhaps the most persuasive element of all.

The rules are simple. Here they are.

1. Don't try to hide your shortcomings. People are smart. They will see straight through you.
2. Bring up questions and objections and answer them in a straight-forward and frank way.
3. Keep it simple.
4. Tell the truth
3. Don't make shit up.

### Example 1: Precise Builder

Precise Builder is a estimating and project management software designed for exterior contractors. As a group, their greatest hesitation is the initial learning of the software among their team. To make the coppy believable, we told the truth&mdash;that *is* a hurdle of new software. But our team will see you through it and in the end it'll be totes worth it.

> *Learning a new software takes time and effort&mdash;and Precise Builder is no different. Let our team walk with you until your crews are completely comfortable. If after six months Precise Builder hasn’t become one of the most valuable tools at your company, we’ll give you your money back&mdash;and help you find a different software.*

### Example 2: Smucker Exteriors

Smucker Exteriors (one of the exterior contractors using Precise Builder) said the main reason clients don't go through with projects is the price&mdash;and that they quote higher. So, we said so&mdash;and then explained why it's worth it.

> *There’s no question about it. Upgrading your home is an investment. And truth-be-told, Smucker Exteriors sometimes comes in higher than the competition. There’s a reason for that.*
>
> *Because we quote fair prices for service that goes above and beyond. And we’re legit&mdash;our employees are vetted at the highest possible level. The guys have integrity.‍*
>
> *To be fair, you should shop around to make sure you’re getting the best deal. But before you go with the lowballers, ask if they’re PA licensed and fully insured. If not, it could come back to haunt you.*

### Example 3: Magic Stat Thermostat

This is some great ad copy by Joe Sugarman selling a Magic Stat thermostat. The opening three paragraphs got into everything he *hated* about the product. Then (naturally) he showed how those minor issues were nothing compared to how easy to install and set the thing is.

> *You're probably expecting our typical sales pitch, but get ready for a shock. For instead of trying to tell you waht a great product the Magic Stat thermostat is, we're going totear is apart. Unmercifully.*
>
> *When we first saw the Magic Stat, we took one look at the name and went "Yuck." We took one look at the plastic case and said "How cheap looking." And when we looked for the digital readout, it had none. So before the salesman ever showed us how it worked, we were totally turned off.*
>
>***REAL LOSER***
>
> *So there is was&mdash;at first blush a real loser. But wait, we did find one good feature&mdash;a feature that led us to a discovery...*

### Additional Ideas

Here's a neat one. Include negative reviews and flaws in your copy and then show why the reviews aren't bad at all. (And might be perfect for the right customer.)

Something else to try: head to Amazon and read some four-star reviews. Often, these reviews explain what people like about the product with the one or two things they wish were different. They give you an excellent idea of whether of not you can live with those "shortcomings."

### Action Items

I like to think of this honesty bit as making "concessions."

What concessions can you make about your product?

What stinks about it?

Try listing all objections on a side of paper and then resolving those objections, turning them into opportunities. Show how they are minor... Or how a certain kind of person would benefit.

Then, bring up the biggest concerns in your kickass copy!
