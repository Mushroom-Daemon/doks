## this stuff is where it's at here...

In other words, don’t try to hide things. Don’t beat around the bush. Don’t make shit up. Bring up questions and objections and answer them in a straight-forward, honest, and credible way. Doing so will make your arguments far more persuasive because they’ll be believable—perhaps the most persuasive element of all.

And when you get down to it, people will do crazy, crazy shit for something they believe in. Heck, they might even read what you wrote.

So there you go. Your first lesson. Tell the truth. (And don’t make shit up.)

(This is also one of my favorite persuasive elements)...


People want to buy from someone they trust.


Maybe this section is just about being credible, honest, and having integrity. An introduction to that. They are powerful in and of themselves. Just do it that way. Don't be a schemer.

These are my "concessions."

Look, you can go to so-and-so and get the same basic thing for a cheaper price. What you pay for here is a relationship... or whatever.

People can tell. The consumer is smart. They will have their doubts. Bring them up in the beginning.

It's about building trust. People want to buy from someone they trust.

Do not try to cover anything up; It will not work.

Be simple, truthful, and frank. Especially about your "shortcomings," which don't amount to a whole lot, anyway.

Be alarmingly truthful. Disarmingly truthful. And win more sales.

Precise Builder example.

This also relates to raising dirty laundry.

Story: People are on guard.

Story: People can tell when you're trying to cover something up.


How can you include total transparency?

Like, I'm not this or that. I'm not such and such. I'm just a regular guy who does this a few hours per week because I enjoy getting folks started on the right foot. The people I work with really appreciate it---and maybe that's you, too.

be totally *transparent* ... that's really the key. and it's credible.

people respect the truth

But What About the Cost?

There’s no question about it. Upgrading your home is an investment. And truth-be-told, Smucker Exteriors sometimes comes in higher than the competition. There’s a reason for that.

Because we quote fair prices for service that goes above and beyond. And we’re legit – our employees are vetted at the highest possible level. The guys have integrity.‍

To be fair, you should shop around to make sure you’re getting the best deal. But before you go with the lowballers, ask if they’re PA licensed and fully insured. If not, it could come back to haunt you.

people tell you their red flags upfront

can they use something else? do they have other options?k

Ideas…

  • Include negative reviews and flaws (and then, of course, show why those reviews aren't that bad at all. The "Too Advanced" review.
