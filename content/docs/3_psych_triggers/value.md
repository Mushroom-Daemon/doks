Everybody wants to know they're getting their money's worth. Period.

This is *espcially* true if you're selling a premium product, or something that will require a large investment from your prospect. However, no matter the price...

To do this, educate your prospect on the inherent value of your product of offering. Show them why it work, make sure they know what's special or unique about it&mdash;the care that goes into making something so amazing.

A company I think does a great job of this is Saddleback Leather based in Fort Worth, TX. Their entire marketing strategy is based on durability... And they take every opportunity to hammer that home (and the value of their products) with tidbits like:

> * Why a full grain leather exterior and pigskin lining are the best choice for a wallet
> * Why they stitch at seven holes per inch rather than the industry nine (less tearing over time)
> * Where they decided to include corner stitching (and not) for allowing easy access, keeping the wallet flat, and securing bills
> * How they use German-engineered industrial marine grade polyester thread (same stuff they use in parachutes) to sew their leather

Plus, they offer a 100-year warranty and their company tagline is "They'll Fight Over it When You're Dead." I mean, c'mon. It was a no-brainer. I bought the _ in dark coffee brown and it's going strong.

### Another Heading to Break Things Up

It feels *good* to know things. Being able to speak like an expert feels good. You appreciate your belongings more.

Another way you can do this is by making honest comparisons to similar products. If you're selling it an expensive bicycle or moped, compare it to the cost of owning an automobile.

You can also make comparisons to more or less expensive models. I can't really speak to this, but apparently, in print (your kickass copy) you will find success in attracting them to a less expensive model. Then, upsell the more expensive later in the copy. Apparently the opposite works in person.

At any rate, educating your prospects to the inherent value of your product is akin to lowering the price. So be sure to do it. It'll make your copy that much more kickass.

### Action Items
1. How can you prove, without the shadow of a doubt, your prospect is getting their money's worth (or whatever they're putting on the line)?
2. In what ways can you educate your prospects to the inherent value of your product, offering, or service? How does it work? What makes it unique?
3. How can you make your offering seem like as much of a bargain as possible?
