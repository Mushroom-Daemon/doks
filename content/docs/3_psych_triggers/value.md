* When we buy, it's an emotional decision, but we have to be able to justify that cost
* I do this with girlfriends. I stick with them because of some underlying emotional need... but I do a good job of explaining to myself why it's a good idea when the doubt creeps in
* Proving the value of your product is a great way to provide that justification
* **You want them to feel like they're getting their money's worth**
	* To do this, educate them
	* It feels *good* to know stuff about whatever you're buying
	* You're essentially lowering the price... because they get a little lesson as well (welts? what do i know about... )
	* Show honest comparisons with other products
		* The product may be an abstraction. Like, not other pinball devices, but other entertainment devices (or transit or whatever)

Can you...
* Show that your product will, in the long haul, give more value than any other choice possible, period.
* How can you make it seem like as much of a bargain as possible?

### Extras
* in print, attract with a cheaper model, then upgrade. do the opposite in person.
