### Edit for Specificity

Find any vague claims you have made in your copy and make them more specific (unless you're playing on hope). Be exacting in your explanations of why things are and how they work. Doing so makes you seem more credible... And as a result, *believable*!

Here are a few examples.

##### Example 1:

> *"New dentists everywhere use and recommend CapSnap toothpase."*

vs.

> *"92 percent of dentists use and recommend..."*

</br>

##### Example 2:

> *"Your feet are filled with nerve endings."*

vs.

> *"There are 72,000 nerve endings in the bottom of your feet."*

</br>

##### Example 3:

> *"BluBlocker sunglasses let you see clearer, sharper, and with more definition."*

vs.

> *"... blue rays have one of the shortest wavelengths in the visible spectum (red is the longest). As a result, the color blue will focus slightly in front of the retina which is the "focusing screen" in your eye. By blocking the blue from the sunlight through a special filtration process, and only letting those rays through that indeed focus clearly on the retina, object appear to be sharper and clearer.*
>
> *The second reason...*

</br>

### A Human Touch

Bottom line: you want people to read your copy and feel as if they know you!

* Tell stories
* Use humor (appropriately... James)
* Write in the first person when possible

</br>

### Tell Stories

Most important thing: that they read your copy.

People love stories. Why? I don't really know or care. But if you want your reader to pay attention, tell them a story.

* What stories can you tell related to your offering?
* Is there a story behind your discovery of this product?
* What is the story of what you *do*? How did you get here?
* Are there any stories about you or your customers that are of interest?

And here's a wilcard.

* Tell a story that has nothing to do with your product or offering. It's just a good way to get someone's attention!

### Fear

* FOMO
* Fear of crime
* Fear of death
* Fear of aging
  * Fear of not being able to bang
  * Fear of not being attractive
* Fear of losing money

Use fear careefully in response to some perceived danger or lossthat one might have to face (What's at stake?)

### Linking

This is a good wayt to get them to understand/relate to the product.

Relating to what a customer already knows and understands is a great way to get them to understand your product. Make it easy to understand and relate to.

A smoke alarm is like a nose that sniffs the air.

All integrated circuits use gold. But tell them it uses gold and suddenly it's of "quality."

Start car from afar. Good to help mafia members not get eliminated. Also good for starting on a cold day.

Vitamins for your car.

what are they called? Metaphors? Similes? I mostly find the use of "like" annoying.

### Instant Gratification

* Assure them you ship promptly and they'll have their stuff in a few days
* List any advantages of ordering by mail
* Something, something, something as you quickly master this skill

### Fads and Current Affairs

What are people talking about?

What's in trend right now?

What's in popular demand?

What's in the news?

What do people know a lot about?

The snowmobile guy banned women during the women's lib movement. Then rescinded and they flocked to him.

Women were burning bras. Guy made a bra pizza.

* "Normal" isn't coming back. Jesus is.
* Blublockers alleviate all three side effects of Viagra

### Sell Cures, Not Preventions

Title basically says it all. Sell wrinkle cream to people *with* wrinkles. Emphasize the curative aspects and underplay the preventative.

Unless you are trying to protect someone you love.

How can you make your product a "cure"

### Exclusitivy, Rarity, or Uniqueness

Also it's just about them feeling special. Make them feel special by offering them something only a few get to take advantage of.

Collectibles, limited editions, short production run, *really* expensive, anything to make it unique. Autographs, etc.

This ties into the desire to belong and also scarcity...

Basically, people get to join a special group by pushasing.

Exclusivity *can* lead to growth in value. It doesn't always, but people are into it.

"Only six made. We've been given two and have already sold one."

How can you make your product exclcusive by limiting its availability and making this fact known? how can you show demand and make your product scarce?

### Even *YOU* Can Do It!

This is something I come across in ads a lot. Basically, telling someone that *they too* can experience this amazing transformation. Here are a few examples.

> *"A great many have the idea that the ability to remember a large number of faces, facts and figures is a gift&mdash;that you have to come by it naturally. Nothing could be further from the truth. Any man, woman, or child of average intelligence can easily and quickly acquire a dependable memory."*

(He then goes on to tell a story of how a loser nobody tried his training and is now an *expert* on memory... Doing impossible things!)

> *"Mr. Rothâ€™s system, which he has developed through years of study* (authority LINK)*, and which he has taught in class to hundreds of business men and others throughout the country and in person* (more authority) *is so easy* (great word) *that a twelve year old child can learn it* (even YOU)*, and it is more real fun than any game you play solely for pleasure.*

One more example I liked was from an online stretching course. The creator showed how he taught his entire film crew to touch their heads to their toes. It was persuasive AF.

(That guy has amazing ads.)

### Involvement Devices

Always remember the main goal of kickass copy:

Getting your reader to read it, top to bottom. A great way to do that is using something can an involvement device.

An involvement devic is a way of involving your prospect in the selling process. In person, this is the test drive, or asking them to open the box, or hold a spare part while you describe it. In writing, you're looking for a way to get the reader directly engaged with your copy.

Here are a few examples.

* Joe Sugarman had readers circle misspelled words in an ad for a spelling check. Each correctly circled word gave them a $2 discount. The people who needed the device most paid the most.
* Can you get them to trace something? Draw on the ad in some way? Click something on the screen?
* On digital platforms, can you include some kind of game?
* I once wrote a letter to my VP at Integro asking for a reimbursement on an expensive text. In the letter, I asked him to try and identify the number of persuasive elements I included in the copy.

##### Action Items

How can you get the reader to engage with your copy? Doing so makes it a pretty kickass read.

### Lower the Bar to Entry

People have a tendency to want to act consistently with their prior choices. That means that once they see your aim or whatever as a part of their lives, they're much more likely to continue taking steps with you in the future.

As a kickass copywriter&mdash;that write kickass copy that *converts*&mdash;that means getting them to a place where they can say "yes." Because once they do, the playing field has been changed.

But there's something more to it. You alwo want to diminish the committment of some products. This may tie back into resolving objections. Here are a few examples.

> *MeetCute is a creative writing guide designed to unleash your creativity... In less time than it takes to drink 2 (maybe 3) cups of coffee."*

A physical exercise program I purchased promised results training *just one time per week*.

##### Action Items

What's an invitation your reader can say "yes" to?

How can you make the work ahead seem as easy as possible?

### Tell Them Why

Here's one I should try more often with my kids.

Tell your reader *why* you're doing certain things, offering them a great deal, asking them to take action. It makes you more credible.

A few things to think about:

* Why are you offering this special deal?
* Why did you start the company?
* Why is your product placed that way in relation to the competition?
* Explain *everything*: shipping costs, ad costs, whatever... include the stuff that helps readers understand you better

### Self-Identity and Belonging

My girlfriend thinks her beater Prius makes it look like she cares about the environment. There are no shortage of displayed rainbows amongst the queer community. I think my RedWings make me look like a cool guy.

People don't buy a Mercedes because it has power steering.

##### Action Items

Determine the group of people who already own your product and why/how they relate to it and see themselves. Craft your sales presentations accordingly.
