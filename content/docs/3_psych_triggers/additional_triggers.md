### A Human Touch

Bottom line: you want people to read your copy and feel as if they know you!

* Tell stories
* Use humor (appropriately... James)
* Write in the first person when possible

### Tell Stories

Most important thing: that they read your copy.

People love stories. Why? I don't really know or care. But if you want your reader to pay attention, tell them a story.

* What stories can you tell related to your offering?
* Is there a story behind your discovery of this product?
* What is the story of what you *do*? How did you get here?
* Are there any stories about you or your customers that are of interest?

And here's a wilcard.

* Tell a story that has nothing to do with your product or offering. It's just a good way to get someone's attention!

### Fear



* FOMO
* Fear of crime
* Fear of death
* Fear of aging
  * Fear of not being able to bang
  * Fear of not being attractive
* Fear of losing money

Use fear careefully in response to some perceived danger or lossthat one might have to face (What's at stake?)

### Linking

This is a good wayt to get them to understand/relate to the product.

Relating to what a customer already knows and understands is a great way to get them to understand your product. Make it easy to understand and relate to.

A smoke alarm is like a nose that sniffs the air.

All integrated circuits use gold. But tell them it uses gold and suddenly it's of "quality."

Start car from afar. Good to help mafia members not get eliminated. Also good for starting on a cold day.

Vitamins for your car.

what are they called? Metaphors? Similes? I mostly find the use of "like" annoying.

### Instant Gratification

* Assure them you ship promptly and they'll have their stuff in a few days
* List any advantages of ordering by mail
* Something, something, something as you quickly master this skill

### Fads and Current Affairs

What are people talking about?

What's in trend right now?

What's in popular demand?

What's in the news?

What do people know a lot about?

The snowmobile guy banned women during the women's lib movement. Then rescinded and they flocked to him.

Women were burning bras. Guy made a bra pizza.

* "Normal" isn't coming back. Jesus is.
* Blublockers alleviate all three side effects of Viagra

### Sell Cures, Not Preventions

Title basically says it all. Sell wrinkle cream to people *with* wrinkles. Emphasize the curative aspects and underplay the preventative.

Unless you are trying to protect someone you love.

How can you make your product a "cure"

### Exclusitivy, Rarity, or Uniqueness

Also it's just about them feeling special. Make them feel special by offering them something only a few get to take advantage of.

Collectibles, limited editions, short production run, *really* expensive, anything to make it unique. Autographs, etc.

This ties into the desire to belong and also scarcity...

Basically, people get to join a special group by pushasing.

Exclusivity *can* lead to growth in value. It doesn't always, but people are into it.

"Only six made. We've been given two and have already sold one."

How can you make your product exclcusive by limiting its availability and making this fact known? how can you show demand and make your product scarce?
