After you've written your copy, read through and make your claims more specific. Be exacting in your explanations of why things are and how they work. Doing so makes you seem more credible... And as a result, *believable*!

Here are a few examples.

> *"New dentists everywhere use and recommend CapSnap toothpase."*

vs.

> *"92 percent of dentists use and recommend..."*

Or...

> *"Your feet are filled with nerve endings."*

vs.

> *"There are 72,000 nerve endings in the bottom of your feet."*

### Other Ideas

Show the exact cost of an ad and the exact cost of a product to prove you aren't making any money. (Let them figure that out on their own for greater mental engagement.)

Do not make vague claims that simply say things work like...

> *"BluBlocker sunglasses let you see clearer, sharper, and with more definition."*

But rather, explain *how* they work.

> *"First, the blue rays have one of the shortest wavelengths in the visible spectum (red is the longest). As a result, the color blue will focus slightly in front of the retina which is the "focusing screen" in your eye. By blocking the blue from the sunlight through a special filtration process, and only letting those rays through that indeed focus clearly on the retina, object appear to be sharper and clearer.*
