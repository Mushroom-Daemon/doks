What is this? Is it elsewhere?

Also, am I being credible? I don't need to include *everything*. Especially what I don't know from experience.

*the experience of using it
* wht is the product *like* (a nose sniffind air)
* these products are just *top sellers* (this is the concept... winners, not the products themselves.headline: "Winners")
* don't sell the chess unit. sell the challenge between soviet and the comp.

This might just be the nature of the product.
