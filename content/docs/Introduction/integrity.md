This might go at the top… Along with "honesty."

Keep your communications straight-forward, honest, and credible. Simple.

This is just a guiding principle. Write with integrity. Only write it if you believe it. Don't make shit up.

Without integrity, the remaining persuasive elements will be useless. They may work for a time, but you will be found out.

An advertisement is a personal message from an organization or an individual and is a direct reflection of the writer's personality and integrity

Align yourself with your thoughts, words, and deeds. Walk the talk.

So this isn't about copy, per say, but it is about persuasion.




Ways to give your ad integrity:
  • The look of your ad
  • Clean and neat
Even the typeface you choose
