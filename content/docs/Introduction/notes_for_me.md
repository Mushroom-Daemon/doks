Write with integrity. Only include examples I actually relate to. Don't regurgitate.

edit: go through all triggers and see if I have questions for those.


put that I am a Grammy award winning trumpeter, educator and I also am the Senior Copywriter at a business development firm where I write for our external clients.

Include an actual CHECKLIST at the end (I can do that, I think) that links to every element.

Get them to *practice* these. Maybe just a few a day. You'll get the hang of it. Also works for me as an assignment. (for my juniors)
