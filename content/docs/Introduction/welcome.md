Who is this for? someone that wants to get what they want through the written word. Sarah... Teddy... who?

Welcome to the Kickass Copy Playbook&mdash;a practical, user-friendly guide to writing kickass copy that converts.

The Kickass Copy Playbook was written for anyone interested in writing persuasive copy&mdash;whether you write ads for a living, hope to suade donors or volunteers to give more of themselves, or just want to convince the girl next door you're worth it. I've tried it all, and through my mistakes and collosal failures have learned a thing of two that works. You'll find that here.

But there's more to it than that. I've also stolen and learned from some of the best. Direct-response legends like Eugene Schwartz, Joseph Sugarman, Mel Martin, Gary Halpbert, Gary Bencivenga, Tom McElligot, and more. All folks who've moved hearts, minds, and a hell of a lot of money through the power of the written word.

Here you'll find a step-by-step the tips, tricks, and teachings as laid out by these masters. All in an easy to digest, checklist format... For free. But before we begin, I want to share one more thing.

I believe in you. And I am of the opinion that anyone, yes *anyone*&mdash;*even you!*&mdash;can learn to write kickass copy that converts. It isn't that hard. You just need to tap into what makes people tick&mdash;and you're the perfect person to do that. (You are a person, afterall.)

So have fun moving through these mini lessons. The first section "Persuasion Playbook" (better name) gets into the heart of persuasion&mdash;how to attract, inspire, move and change.

Read each section one at a time. Reflect on the teachings and ask yourself how do you relate to them. Where have you seen this, experienced it for yourself? How do you *already know this stuff*?

Once you've moved through and have an overview of the persuasion bits, you can use the quick checklists...

But getting to know our funny human ways is only half of the equation, which is why I've included the following...

"All Write, Already" is where I share with you the most valuable tips I know for getting the work done&mdash;for *writing*. It's an important part of the gig. And when you find your process, I think you'll find it can be a lot of fun, as well.

So let's go. Join me on an incredible adventure. The Kickass Copy Playbook awaits and it starts on the next page.
