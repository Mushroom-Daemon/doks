Welcome to the Kickass Copy Playbook&mdash;a practical, user-friendly guide for writing kickass copy that converts.

The Kickass Copy Playbook was written for anyone interested in writing persuasive copy&mdash;regardless of whether you write ads for a living, hope to persuade someone of something, or just want to convince the girl next door that you're not a total creep. I've tried both. (Some with greater success than others.) And through my many trials and failures have learned a thing or two I've found helpful. You'll find those tips here. But that's not all.

I've also stolen from some of the best direct-response copywriters throughout the ages. Characters like Eugene Schwartz, Joseph Sugarman, Mel somebody, Gary Bencivenga, and more. All folks who made fortunes selling with the power of the written word... And who liked to teach and share their insights. Here you'll find the tips, tricks, and teachings as laid out by these masters. All in an easy to digest, checklist format... For free.

Before we move on, I'm of the opinion that anyone, yes *anyone*&mdash;*even you!*&mdash;can learn to write kickass copy that converts. Really, it isn't that hard. Hell, it's even kind of fun. And in the following pages you'll find everything you need to succeed.
