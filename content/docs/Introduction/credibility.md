Credibility is about being believable. That is the most persuasive bit of all. If someone doesn't believe you, you're not going to inspire them to act. People will do crazy shit for something they believe in though.

Being believable comes back to honesty, I think. And raising objections.

It's about justifications---justifying a super low price. how can you offer this? I call it tell them why.

It means resolving all objections that come up in your prospects mind.

  â€¢ :To make it easy, we provide you with the tools. In our tests, it only took five minutes for somebody with very little mechanical skill to put it together."

Answer questions in a straight-forward, honest and credible way.

THIS COULD ALSO GO WITH THE QUESTIONS... THEY ARE WHAT ALLOW YOU TO ANSWER IN A STRAIGHT-FORWARD, HONEST, AND CREDIBLE WAY.

You will also become more credible when you add specificity, which you will learn how to do later. And authority and this and that, all of which you will learn to do as you read on.

Get people to read on!

The moment hte ready says no or i dont believe this or i don't think this is mean, you've lost them. but if they keep saying yes or believing what youre saying is correct and stays interested... you're doing it.
