This is about **Integrity**

In the lessons that follow, you will learn some of the most useful elements of persuasion in written copy&mdash;how to channel your prospect’s innermost desires and link them to your cause, product, or offer in a unique way that inspires action. Learning to do this is a superpower that must be treated with wielded responsibly. It is a means of manipulation.

Doing so, in my most humble opinion, is not about trickery.

* This is a guiding principle–without it, the other persuasive elements might as well be useless; they may work for a time, but the truth always comes out
* Write with integrity
* Only write it if you believe it
* If you believe it, others will too&mdash;this gives you credibility
* the ad is a reflection of the company, yes, but also you

(is this a separate thing? credibility with persuasion and integrity with writing?)

Credibility is about being believable&mdash;perhaps the most persuasive element of all. if someone doesn’t believe you, they don’t trust you, and you aren’t going to inspire them to act. The moment the reader says no or i don’t believe this or I don’t think this is me, they’re gone. You’ve lost them. On the flip side, people will do crazy shit for something they believe in&mdash;love, this, this… Crazy, crazy shit. (heck, they might even read all of your copy.)

To be believable, be honest. Raise common objections and air them out in the light of day&mdash;*own them*. Tell your prospects why. Be specific with your copy. Answer questions/Keep your communication straight-forward, honest, and credible. Don’t beat around the bush. And don’t make shit up.


* Align yourself with your thoughts, words, and deeds


So there you have it. Your first lesson. Don’t make shit up. Don’t be a bullshitter.
