Who is this for? someone that wants to get what they want through the written word. Sarah... Teddy... who?

Welcome to the Kickass Copy Playbook&mdash;a practical, user-friendly guide to writing kickass copy that converts.

The Kickass Copy Playbook was written for anyone interested in persuasive writing&mdash;whether you write ads for a living, hope to suade donors or volunteers to give more of themselves, or just want to convince the girl next door you're totally worth it. I've tried it all, and through my sucesses and mistakes have learned a thing or two that work. You'll find that here. ... improve clik-thru... whatever.

But there's more to it than that. I've also learned and stolen from some of the best. Direct-response legends like Eugene Schwartz, Joseph Sugarman, Mel Martin, Gary Halpbert, Gary Bencivenga, Tom McElligot, and more. All folks who've moved hearts, minds, and a hell of a lot of money through the power of the written word.

Here you'll find a step-by-step the tips, tricks, and teachings as laid out by these masters. All in an easy to digest, checklist format... For free. But before we begin, I want to share one more thing.

I believe in you. And I am of the opinion that anyone, yes *anyone*&mdash;*even you!*&mdash;can learn to write kickass copy that converts. It isn't that hard. You just need to tap into what makes people tick&mdash;and you're the perfect person to do that. (You are a person, afterall.)

So have fun moving through these mini lessons. The "Persuasion Playbook" (better name) gets into the heart of persuasion&mdash;how to attract, inspire, move your prospect and create change. Many (most) of the persuasive bits covered here are from Joseph Sugarman's "Triggers" as covered in his great book, the Adweek ... I've also mixed in lots of other things I've picked up along the way and organized the material in a way that, I think, makes sense.

Read each section one at a time. Reflect on the teachings and ask yourself how do you relate to them. Where have you seen this, experienced it for yourself? How do you *already know this stuff*?

You have to write. But getting to know our funny human ways is only half of the equation, which is why I've included the following...


"All Write, Already" is where I share with you the most valIuable tips I know for getting the work done&mdash;for *writing*. As a copy*writer* it is an important part of the gig, afterall. And when you find what works for you, I think you'll find it can be a lot of fun, as well.

And once you've moved through and have an overview of the persuasion bits, you can use the quick checklists... you can find here. (link) But there's still more to it than that.

So let's go. Join me on an incredible adventure. Master the skills to ... The Kickass Copy Playbook awaits and it starts on the next page.
