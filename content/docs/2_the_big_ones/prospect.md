Here's the bottom line of kickass copy that converts.

Put the needs and wants of your prospect first. It's that simple.

It doesn't take genius. It's just the simple matter of listening and observing. And maybe a little intuition helps, too.

who are you selling to and what do they want?

**What is the transformation they are hoping for?**

Just give the people what they want. Being in a frat is only as appealing and chicks and friends.

The prospect has basic emotional needs your product will solve&mdash;regardless of what it is.

It is through *emotion* that you will reach the core essence of your prospect's motivation. It is from this essence that you will get all the clues you need to uncover the way to that prospect's heart and soul and eventually to his or her pocketbook.

* Appeal to their *true* interests--not what they say
* The key is to gather as much information about them as possible. Study them. Listen. Pay Attention. This is why you get to know them and their hobbies. To gain a sense of their emotional needs. Safety. Security. Fun and Novelty. Whatever.

Do not try to communicate *to* this person. *Become this person*.

incentives:
  1. figure out what people really care about—not what they say they do
  2. pay attention to how people respond; keep experimenting

### A Note on Belonging

Another way to think about this is our desire to *belong*. We want to belong to certain groups, and herd mentality influences everything&mdash;from your politics to what you eat and how you dress.

My girlfriend thinks her beater Prius makes it look like she cares about the environment. There are no shortage of displayed rainbows amongst the queer community. And, at the end of the day, I think my RedWings make me look like a cool guy.

However someone wants to see themselves, *treat them that way*.

### Action Items

Determine the group of people who already own your product and why/how they relate to it and see themselves. Craft your sales presentations accordingly.
