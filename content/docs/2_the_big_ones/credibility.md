In the lessons that follow, you will learn the basics of persuasive writing. As far as I'm concerened, that's magic&mdash;linking your prospect's inner most desires to your cause, product, or offering in a way that inspires action.

Before that, though, I want to call out the elephant in the room. Many people are of the opinion that marketers (which as a persuasive writer, you are) are practicing a kind of dark magic. They're manipulators. They'll do anything for a sale. And I, too, have doubted the marketing tactics used by certain parties.

*this is what we will choose to believe*

I think what's important to understand is that manipulation and persuasion have a core difference. They're tactics with a different end goal... riding a different wave, so to speak. Manipulative practices are are deceptive. They exploit the vulnerable (and aren't we all) and lead them into making decisions not in their best interest. Persuasion, on the other hand, is this.

The pursuit of truth. Seek the truth, believe it, and you will find yourself a persuasive writer. It isn't always easy. You'll have to dig for it. But the end result will be worth your troubles. For without this belief in what you're trying to communicate as the backbone of your writing, the other tactics on this website might as well be useless; they may work for a time, but the truth always comes out.

Believability may be the most important persuasive element of all. And you've got to understand something: people are smart. They can sniff out the bullshit. If someone doesn't believe you, you aren't going to inspire the kind of response you want. On the flip side, people will do crazy shit for something they believe in&mdash;love, this, this… Crazy, crazy shit. (heck, they might even read all of your copy.)

So what's the big deal here? To write with integrity. To only write what you believe. To bring up and answer common questions and objections in a straight-forward, honest, and credible way. Don't hide things. Don't beat around the bush. Don't make shit up.

So there you have it. Your first lesson. Tell the truth. And don’t make shit up.
