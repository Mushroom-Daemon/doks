In the lessons that follow, you will learn the basics of persuasive writing. As far as I'm concerened, that's magic&mdash;linking your prospect's inner most desires to your cause, product, or offering in a way that inspires action.

Before that, though, I want to call out the elephant in the room. Many people are of the opinion that marketers (which as a persuasive writer, you are) are practicing a kind of dark magic. They're manipulators. They'll do anything for a sale. And I, too, have doubted the marketing tactics used by certain parties.

I think what's important to understand is that manipulation and persuasion have a core difference. They're riding a different wave, so to speak. Manipulative practices are those that are deceptive. They exploit the vulnerable (and we all are) and lead them into making a decision that is not in their best interest. Persuasion has a different bent.

That's the pursuit of truth.




But I don't believe that is the case. And here's why.

Manipulation is a practice of deceipt or trickery or ... which is why it's so important for you, as a persuasive writer, to practice integrity.




 channeling your prospect’s innermost desires and linking them to your cause, product, or offer in a way that inspires action.

As far as I'm concerned, learning to do this is magic. And as such, it's a superpower that must be wielded responsibly

Because there is a fine line between persuasion and manipulation. Persuasion is the pursuit of truth. Seek the truth, believe it, and you will find yourself a persuasive writer. It is a means of manipulation. Manipulation, on the other hand, involves using deceptive or coercive tactics to exploit vulnerabilities or mislead someone into making a decision that is not in their best interest. It often involves hidden motives and a lack of transparency.

Doing so, in my most humble opinion, is not about trickery.

* This is a guiding principle–without it, the other persuasive elements might as well be useless; they may work for a time, but the truth always comes out
* Write with integrity
* Only write it if you believe it
* If you believe it, others will too&mdash;this gives you credibility
* the ad is a reflection of the company, yes, but also you

(is this a separate thing? credibility with persuasion and integrity with writing?)

Credibility is about being believable&mdash;perhaps the most persuasive element of all. if someone doesn’t believe you, they don’t trust you, and you aren’t going to inspire them to act. The moment the reader says no or i don’t believe this or I don’t think this is me, they’re gone. You’ve lost them. On the flip side, people will do crazy shit for something they believe in&mdash;love, this, this… Crazy, crazy shit. (heck, they might even read all of your copy.)

To be believable, be honest. Raise common objections and air them out in the light of day&mdash;*own them*. Tell your prospects why. Be specific with your copy. Answer questions/Keep your communication straight-forward, honest, and credible. Don’t beat around the bush. And don’t make shit up.


So there you have it. Your first lesson. Don’t make shit up. Don’t be a bullshitter.

Ways to give your ad integrity:
  • The look of your ad
  • Clean and neat
Even the typeface you choose


By searching for safety I make myself feel unsafe. Do not search for the thing you want. Act. And let that identity fall over you. I dig through the past, rifle through the files, every word, every conversation, every assumption. And in doing so---in searching for the one thing I so desperately crave---I make myself feel unsafe.
