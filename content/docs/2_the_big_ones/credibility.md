*** what;s a story about integrity***?

In the lessons that follow, you will learn the basics of persuasive writing. As far as I'm concerened, this is akin to wielding magic&mdash;the magic of finding, channeling, and linking your prospect's inner most desires to your cause or offering in a way that inspires action.

It's this magic that drew me to the field of copywriting and holds my attention today. It's also why I built this site... To share some of my favorite magic ingredients for you to use concocting potions of your own. But before we get into all that, there's one thing I'd like to address.

Many people are of the opinion that marketers (which, as a persuasive writer, you are) are practicing a kind of *dark* magic. They're manipulators who will do and say anything for a sale. Snake oilers how simply want to win you over to their vantage for their own benefit. And the thing is, sometimes these people are right.

However, there is a difference between persuasion and manipulation. Manipulation is deceptive. It exploits the vulnerable and leads them into making decisions that are not in their best interest. Manipulation is a win-lose kind of deal.

Persuasion, on the other hand, serves both sides of the equation. It is the pursuit of truth&mdash;your truth and mine and aligning them in a way that spurs positive action. Seek this truth, believe in it, and you will find your arguments far more persuasive.






It isn't always easy. You'll have to dig for it. To challenge yourself to listen and remain curious. But in a way, that makes your job even easier. You'll never have to make shit up.  but you'll never, ever have to make shit up. The answers are already out there. And the end result will be worth your effort.

So what's the big deal here? To write with integrity. To bring up and answer common questions and objections in a straight-forward, honest, and credible way. To only write what you believe. Don't hide things. Don't beat around the bush. Don't make shit up.


Believability may be the most important persuasive element of all. And you've got to understand something: people are smart. They can sniff out the bullshit. If someone doesn't believe you, you aren't going to inspire the kind of response you want. On the flip side, people will do crazy shit for something they believe in&mdash;love, this, this… Crazy, crazy shit. (heck, they might even read all of your copy.)



So there you have it. Your first lesson. Tell the truth. And don’t make shit up.

In the next one you'll . . .
