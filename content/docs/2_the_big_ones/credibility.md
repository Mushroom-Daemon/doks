When I first discovered the field of copywriting, I was entranced by the concept "junk mail."

To me, if you could send a stranger a letter, get them to open it, *read it*, and then buy whatever it was you were selling, you weilded a magic power. That magic drew me in and plays its part in holding my interest today. (And I still dream of making it big self-publishing or selling pet rocks through the mail.)

My interest in the spells those early direct-response marketers were casting are also part of the reason I built this site... To share some of my favorite magic ingredients so you can use them to concoct potions of your own. Before we get into all that, however, I would like to mention something.

Many people are of the opinion that marketers (which, as a persuasive writer, you are) are practicing a kind of *dark* magic. They're manipulators. Snake oil salesmen who will do or say anything to win you over to their vantage. And the thing is, sometimes those people are right.

Persuasion, on the other hand, is the pursuit of truth&mdash;your truth and mine and aligning those two in a way that inspires positive action. Seek this truth, believe it, and you will find your arguments far more persuasive.

What I'm trying to say is this...

Write with integrity. Don't hide things, don't beat around the bush, and don't make shit up. It is your job to bring up questions and objections and address them in a straight-forward, honest, and credible way. Doing so makes you more believable---perhaps the most persuasive element of all---and people will do crazy shit for something they believe in. They might even read what you wrote.

So there you go. Your first lesson. Tell the truth. And don't make shit up.







Believability may be the most important persuasive element of all. And you've got to understand something: people are smart. They can sniff out the bullshit. ...

 On the flip side, people will do crazy shit for something they believe in&mdash;love, this, thisâ€¦ Crazy, crazy shit. (heck, they might even read all of your copy.)



So t


In the lessons that follow, you will learn the basics of persuasive writing. As far as I'm concerened, this is akin to wielding magic&mdash;the magic of finding, channeling, and linking your prospect's inner most desires to your cause or offering in a way that inspires action.
