*** what;s a story about integrity***?

In the lessons that follow, you will learn the basics of persuasive writing. As far as I'm concerened, that's magic&mdash;and a power that must be weilded responsibly. Do so and melt away your prospect's resistance to your message. Ignore this responsibility and fortify that resistance.

The bottom line is that many people distrust marketers (which as a persuasive writer, you are). Not only are they bombarded with messaging each and every day, lots of folks think of adverters as practicing a kind of *dark* magic. They're manipulators. Snake oilers who'll do anything for a sale. And sometimes they're right. I love the science and art of persuasion and yet have found myself distrusting the marketing tactics of certain parties and organizations in the past.

Because of this, I want to share a helpful distinction&mdash;a distinction to help us move forward productively and positively throughout the remainder of these lessons: the findamentaly differences between persuasion and manipulation.

Simply put, manipulation is deceptive. Manipulative practices exploit the vulnerable (and aren't we all) and lead them into making decisions that are not in their best interest. Fundamentally, it's a win-lose kind of deal.

Persuasion, on the other hand, serves both sides of the equation. It is the pursuit of truth&mdash;your truth and mine and linking them in a way that spurs positive action. Seek this truth, believe it, and you will find yourself far more persuasive.

It isn't always easy. You'll have to dig for it. To challenge yourself to listen and remain curious. But in a way, that makes your job even easier. You'll never have to make shit up.  but you'll never, ever have to make shit up. The answers are already out there. And the end result will be worth your effort.

So what's the big deal here? To write with integrity. To bring up and answer common questions and objections in a straight-forward, honest, and credible way. To only write what you believe. Don't hide things. Don't beat around the bush. Don't make shit up.




For without this belief in what you're trying to communicate as the backbone of your writing, the other tactics on this website might as well be useless; they may work for a time, but the truth always comes out.

Believability may be the most important persuasive element of all. And you've got to understand something: people are smart. They can sniff out the bullshit. If someone doesn't believe you, you aren't going to inspire the kind of response you want. On the flip side, people will do crazy shit for something they believe in&mdash;love, this, this… Crazy, crazy shit. (heck, they might even read all of your copy.)



So there you have it. Your first lesson. Tell the truth. And don’t make shit up.

In the next one you'll . . .
