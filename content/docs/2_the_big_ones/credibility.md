Junk mail. I was mesmerized by it. Still am.

Send a stranger a letter, get them to open it, *read it*, and then buy whatever you're selling? That's magic&mdash;a magic that drew me into this field years ago and a big part of what holds me here today.

 But not everyone has such a positive view on the topic of persuasion. In fact, many folks are of the opinion that marketers (which, as a persuasive writer, you are) are practicing a kind of *dark* magic. They're manipulators. Snake oil salesmen. Shiesters who will do or say anything for a quick buck or vote. And here's the thing.

 Sometimes they're right.

But there's also a positive side to this psychological sorcery&mdash;the good witch or wizard who uses these magic ingredients to concoct potions of mutual benefit. You too can weild these forces for good. And I believe all it takes is this.

Having integrity.

To me, that means pursuing and sharing the truth&mdash;your truth and mine and aligning them in a way that inspires the kind of action where both sides win. To do so, you must *believe* in the message you're sharing. Communicate from this place of belief and I think you'll find others more apt to do the same.

So there you go...
Your first lesson.

Write with integrity.

(And don't be an asshole.)

Now let's get down to business in lesson #2.

This page *is* about honesty. And how being believable is the most persuasive element of all.

The rules are simple. Here they are.

1. Don't try to hide your shortcomings. People are smart. They will see straight through you.
2. Bring up questions and objections and answer them in a straight-forward and frank way.
3. Keep it simple.
4. Tell the truth
3. Don't make shit up.
