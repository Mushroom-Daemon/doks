## The Feeling of Ownership
*Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.*

 &ndash; Benjamin Franklin

when you are selling in person... (then tell them what you can do)

You want them to learn one thing: how using your product is going to make their lives better/transform them into a more self-actualized version of themselves.

The Feeling of Ownership

Here's the deal. Selling things in copy requires a slightly different approach than selling them on the lot. Basically, you've got nothing but words and the reader's imagination to do the job. They can't kick the tires, try on the boots, or kiss their mail-order bride.

So you've got to help them feel those feels. To do that, involve all the senses, get them to imagine touching, using, smelling, hearing your product. See through your eyes, touch through your hands, smell through your nose or feel your feelings.

In print, spell out how they'll use the product in a practical way. Hypnotize them. carry them through the imagery of ownership, of how they'll use the product.

Loosen the tongue and slide on your boots, sinch the laces down and quickly thread them through the speed hooks (faster and faster the more you wear your boots). The leather softens and molds to your feet, for a fit that's all yours and comfortable all day long.

Don't sell them a patio. Sell them the feel of cool stone under their feet on a summer's evening.

Have them take a stroll. Have them easily slip on and go for a run in their new shoes, light as air and soft on the ground.

Hold the Litronix2000 in your hand. See how easily the keys snap to the touch. See how small and light the unit it.

Take a ride in the new Corvette. Feel the breeze blowing through your hair as you drive through the warm evening. Watch heads turn. Punch the accelerator to the floor and feel the burst of power that pins you into the back of your contour seat. Look at the beautiful display of electronic technology right on your dashboard. Feel the power and excitement of Americ's super sports car.

Talk to them as if they already own the product. The more vividily they can see that, the more ready they'll be to make that vision of themselves a reality. Make them believe they are experiencing those things. Fill the vacuum of their mind with the image of what they will be enjoying with your product.

The more you get them involved in that feeling of ownership, the closer you are to a sale.

In person, get them to actually use it. To type in the stuff themselves. Have them do all the work. Just guide them along. Teach me and … involve me and…

TEST CHANGE.


This comes down to them beeing able to *see* what you write. the puppies romping and playing bit.
