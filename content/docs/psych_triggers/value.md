This is a part of logical justification.

But it's a specific niche about it… proving the value of the product. It's a thing.

You want the prospect to feel like they are getting value. You do this by educating the prospect--showing them honest comparisons with other similar products.

You buy a Mercedes emotionally, but justify the purchase logically with its technology, safety, and resale value. Hell, I've done this with girlfriends… every time.

No matter how much money you have, you want to know you're getting good value.

It seems like this is about educating them to the value of your product. This is equivalent to lowering its price. They find value in that education--knowing stuff. It feels good. And people will pay for it. If I knew more about the welts, would I care?

EDUCATION

If your customer doesn't know if they're buying the product at the right price, you aren't communicating effectively.

You need to educate them to all the inherent value of the product that may not be apparent to the casual observer. So, if you're gonna use jargon--tell them what that means.

The goal: to demonstate, by example, that the product you are offering will, in the long haul, give more value than any other choice possible. Period.

In print, attract readers with a lower price model, then sell them the expensive one. Do the opposite in person.

You have a pinball set. It costs $600. Compare it to other entertainment devices.

  • Offer truthful comparisons with other products
  • Possible savings
  •  Educating your reader to the intrinsic value of your product is equivalent to lowering its price, or at a minimum providing greater value

This also ties into greed.

People like to get more than they think they deserve. They buy things they don't need because they're a bargain. (It's like the FREE thing... Do I need to include this?) this takes advantage of GREED/AVARICE

If you take something people want, and suddenly lower the price, they will buy it. (no reasoning required).

Show the delux model, then the basic for way cheaper. COMPARE AND CONTRAST.

MAKE YOU PRODUCT SEEM LIKE A MUCH AS A BARGAIN AS POSSIBLE--EVEN IF IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.  This evokes greed/hoarding/whatever.
