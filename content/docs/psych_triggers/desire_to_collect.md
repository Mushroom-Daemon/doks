I don't know how much this matters for *copy* exactly.

Send a container free of charge. People want to fill it up.

The watch enthusiast is the perfect prospect to sell a watch to.

There are collectors in nearly every business

There are all sorts of people, who, for whatever reason, have an amotional need to collect a series of fimilar products. These products bring them great joy and satasfaction and, in some cases, utility.

Some people aren't even collectors. They just want to find the best backpack and boots.

Once you have a set buying pattern, it's easy and comfortable to keep going. Consistency.

Don't overlook the collecting urge.
