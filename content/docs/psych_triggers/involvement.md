The question is: how can you get them to engage w the copy.

The direct response involvement technique. Basically, get people to engage with your copy. Can you ask them to look for things? To trace something? Circle all the misspelled words and get $2 off for each. The more you need the device, the more you pay.

  • A game
  • A test drive
  • A free lesson
  • A way to try something out or do something… give them an experience
  • Bring a spare part along and ask them to help you open the box… hold the part
