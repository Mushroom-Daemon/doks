Dress for the job you want. Seeing that I distrust pants, I'm destined to write from home. Lucky you.

Selling in person, you want to set up a sales environment.

How have others sold this product? Pattern your approach to theirs. (This is a good one for the copy.)

Get the prospect saying "yes." The slippery slide. Make honest and believable statements. Ones you know they can agree with and not challenge. *You do not want them to challenge the copy*.

## Head-nodding Tags / Head Nodders

Use at the end of a sentence to illicit a "yes."

Couldn't you?
Wouldn't you?
Don't you think?
Eh? (Fucking Canadians. Nice day, eh? That's how they get you, eh?)

It's also about getting people to like you. Dress like your prospect. Become them.

Offer a coffee, have one yourself. Create rapport by mirroring. Match the behavior of your prospect by mirroring their own actions.

Get them in agreement with you.

Who are the winners? What are they doing that's effective? Pattern an approach after theirs&mdash;but with a twist of your own.
