A little while back I decided I wanted to buy a bike. After poking around online, I found one I liked and walked to a local shop to see if they could order for me. They could.

They actually had a few in the shop. I hopped on one and thought it felt great. I ordered the model I wanted online and excitedly awaited my present to myself.




this is about the stress and worry of making the wrong choice. louie took that away and gave me confidence. I felt guilt about returning it to the shop after they ordered and built it. I couldn't get it out of my head for a week. Then I bumped into an unlikely ... saw the mailman.

I whipped around the corner as he was approaching my mailbox. He stopped what he was doing to admire my new ride.  When I pulled up he stopped and was very complimentary of my new ride.

clearly, throw guy new what he was talking about, so I told him my concern: the size?

When I got there, they actually had a few of the model I liked in stock. I rode one around for a bit, thought it was great. I told them I wanted to place an order on Black Friday through the manufacturer and they said that was all good with them, and they'd still assemble the bike in the shop--which ended up being kind of a hassle for them.

what made him a pro? he loves it. he was talking about the features, the paint job, and he just looks like a cyclist. he has the build. I instantly trusted his opinion, for better or worse.

In this case it was for the better.

For starters, the manufacturer sent the wrong bike, so they had to pack it back up and return it. Then, the sent the right bike, but I became the problem. For some reason, it felt too big for me. I couldn’t stand over the bike without getting racked, for one. And the whole thing just felt too big. I was going back and forth and back and forth until someone set me straight.

It was my mailman. He saw me whip around the corner on my new wheels and wanted to talk all about it. This guy, Louie, to me, is an expert. He walks something like eight hours a day, and when he isn't on foot, he's riding around town on his road bike or cargo bike. The dude knows and loves bikes, something he made clear while admiring my new whip.

I told him I was self-conscious about the size choice. He asked if it was because I thought it was too big, which I did. I then explained my complaints to him and he said he believes a person should love their bike---that way they'll ride it. And I should go through the hassle of returning it. So I did.

His authority and strong opinion on the matter---just knowing and loving bikes---helped me make a tough decision with confidence. His reassurance made it okay for me to go with what I thought. I took his advice and now I have a bike I love--and his my
mailman's expert validation and reassurance played no small part in that. Your job as copywriter (or business leader or marketer or whoever) is to provide that reassurance.

HOW CAN YOU HELP THEM FEEL GOOD.

Nobody wants to make a stupid mistake. No one wants to get taken for a ride, scammed, or have buyer's remorse. We seek assurance before and after a big purchase. We want approval. And we go looking for it from our friends.

It is your job to provide that reassurance.

Be the knowledgeable friend, the neutral third-party that wants you to appreciate the money you've spent. You do this by establishing yourself as an authority---by reassuring them that you can solve their problem.

Another way to think about this is through the lens of social proof. What is the reality of working with your product. Show that and it helps others feel at ease.


EXAMPLES
  • do you follow any jurisdictions or rules?

Bottom line, they want to know they are making a good choice.


Other ways to demonstrate authority:
* Brand names and company names: "the tool shack" won't sell many computers.
* Where you post ads: QVC, Amazon, etc.
* The city your business (or mailing address) is in: NYC publisher or jazz musician, an LA studio cat, perfume from Paris, a pub in Glasgow, Brooklyn pizza...

  • maybe even just your top selling products (creator of the … )
  • testimonials (the reality of the product)

  • Any kind of numbers. How many people you've helped, how much your clients grow or improve.
  • How LONG have you been in business? (E&E)
  • Most customers save $600 in their first month (this is also credibility)
  • Awards (Grammy logos, accolades, business logos, media, testimonies…
  • You can even tell your story: "I went bankrupt a long time ago… then I found this… and now I have financial peace and you can, too."
  • a case study
  • on of the companies selling radar detectors–cincinnati microwave–sent three of their top people to my seminar before it really took off and became a $140 million company with over $40 million in profits

    ○ first, I showed my ads and my competitors (the ones
    who were copying my format). Then, as my students became successful using the principles I taught them, I began showing their ads in subsequent seminars.
