After poking around online, I found one I liked and walked to a local shop to see if they could order for me. They could.\nThey actually had a few in the shop. I hopped on one and thought it felt great. I ordered the model I wanted online and excitedly awaited my present to myself.\nthis is about the stress and worry of making the wrong choice. louie took that away and gave me confidence. I felt guilt about returning it to the shop after they ordered and built it. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get it out of my head for a week. Then I bumped into an unlikely \u0026hellip; saw the mailman.\nI whipped around the corner as he was approaching my mailbox. He stopped what he was doing to admire my new ride. When I pulled up he stopped and was very complimentary of my new ride.\nclearly, throw guy new what he was talking about, so I told him my concern: the size?\nWhen I got there, they actually had a few of the model I liked in stock. I rode one around for a bit, thought it was great. I told them I wanted to place an order on Black Friday through the manufacturer and they said that was all good with them, and they\u0026rsquo;d still assemble the bike in the shop\u0026ndash;which ended up being kind of a hassle for them.\nwhat made him a pro? he loves it. he was talking about the features, the paint job, and he just looks like a cyclist. he has the build. I instantly trusted his opinion, for better or worse.\nIn this case it was for the better.\nFor starters, the manufacturer sent the wrong bike, so they had to pack it back up and return it. Then, the sent the right bike, but I became the problem. For some reason, it felt too big for me. I couldn’t stand over the bike without getting racked, for one. And the whole thing just felt too big. I was going back and forth and back and forth until someone set me straight.\nIt was my mailman. He saw me whip around the corner on my new wheels and wanted to talk all about it. This guy, Louie, to me, is an expert. He walks something like eight hours a day, and when he isn\u0026rsquo;t on foot, he\u0026rsquo;s riding around town on his road bike or cargo bike. The dude knows and loves bikes, something he made clear while admiring my new whip.\nI told him I was self-conscious about the size choice. He asked if it was because I thought it was too big, which I did. I then explained my complaints to him and he said he believes a person should love their bike\u0026mdash;that way they\u0026rsquo;ll ride it. And I should go through the hassle of returning it. So I did.\nHis authority and strong opinion on the matter\u0026mdash;just knowing and loving bikes\u0026mdash;helped me make a tough decision with confidence. His reassurance made it okay for me to go with what I thought. I took his advice and now I have a bike I love\u0026ndash;and his my mailman\u0026rsquo;s expert validation and reassurance played no small part in that. Your job as copywriter (or business leader or marketer or whoever) is to provide that reassurance.\nHOW CAN YOU HELP THEM FEEL GOOD.\nNobody wants to make a stupid mistake. No one wants to get taken for a ride, scammed, or have buyer\u0026rsquo;s remorse. We seek assurance before and after a big purchase. We want approval. And we go looking for it from our friends.\nIt is your job to provide that reassurance.\nBe the knowledgeable friend, the neutral third-party that wants you to appreciate the money you\u0026rsquo;ve spent. You do this by establishing yourself as an authority\u0026mdash;by reassuring them that you can solve their problem.\nAnother way to think about this is through the lens of social proof.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been wearing the watch for years and talk about it all the time.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t need a watch. My phone tells time. When I go to the gym, there are clocks on the walls. I just wanted one and found a model that I thought looked cool. I guess I thought owning one might say something about me.\nKnowing I didn\u0026rsquo;t need the watch, I needed to justify the purchase to myself. Granted, it was easy to do. At such a low price point, thinking the watch was cool was reason enough. And in terms of being able to tell time, I could now do that away from my phone. I could time my workouts without needing a clock. And I could look like a guy that appreciates high-quality, lasting, affordable items.\nThe thing is, I wanted the watch before I knew any of that. I just saw it and wanted it. And while we often go to the market looking to solve an external problem—which, admittedly, might not even need solved in the first place—we end up wanting our preferred solution for emotional reasons. Then, we kind of rationalize the choice to ourselves.\nNobody needs a BMW. Nobody needs a Tesla.

Selling things in copy requires a slightly different approach than selling them on the lot. Basically, you\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing but words and the reader\u0026rsquo;s imagination to do the job.

To do that, involve all the senses, get them to imagine touching, using, smelling, hearing your product. See through your eyes, touch through your hands, smell through your nose or feel your feelings.\nIn print, spell out how they\u0026rsquo;ll use the product in a practical way. Hypnotize them. carry them through the imagery of ownership, of how they\u0026rsquo;ll use the product.\nLoosen the tongue and slide on your boots, sinch the laces down and quickly thread them through the speed hooks (faster and faster the more you wear your boots).

See how small and light the unit it.\nTake a ride in the new Corvette. Feel the breeze blowing through your hair as you drive through the warm evening. Watch heads turn.

You do this with your Satisfaction Conviction.\nNaturally, we all have our worries. Your job is to take that worry away.\nThe Satisfaction Conviction is the late-night television salesman saying \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so convinced you\u0026rsquo;ll love this product, I\u0026rsquo;m going to do something crazy.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s a complete risk-reversal, where you show your clients they have nothing to lose.\nDone right, your satisfaction conviction should make your prospects think:\n• Your product or service must truly be phenomenal\nand/or…\n• You (the supplier) are probably going to get taken advantage of\nFor a great example of a Satisfaction Conviction, check out REI\u0026rsquo;s return policy:\nWRITE MY EXAMPLE OF PRECISE BUILDER.\nWhat makes this return policy so great is not just its length\u0026mdash;a generous year long return window (more on that in a minute), but that the great can be returned used. They\u0026rsquo;re essentially letting member kick the tires out in the real world for a full year. Try it out. Give it hell.

What are the most common hesitations or concerns you hear about your product? And don\u0026rsquo;t just assume it\u0026rsquo;s always about money. they worried about losing money? A failing product? Difficulty using your product or getting it serviced?\nIf I go to the grocery store or a box of crackers, I might be worried I don\u0026rsquo;t like the taste, or they\u0026rsquo;re stale. Tell me I can bring them back if think they suck and I\u0026rsquo;m happy.\nBut what if I\u0026rsquo;m more concerned with… Some other example… For example, you might be worried the crackers you buy at the grocery store taste bad, or are stale. The money you spend on software might be wasted if you can\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to use it.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t guess\u0026mdash;ask.\nA Note on Money-Back Trials and Warranties\n(A note on trial periods: typically, the longer the trial the better, and the less it gets taken advantage of. If you offer a two-week trial period, the customer will likely be thinking of whether or not they actually want the product in that two weeks. Make it longer and they relax. They know they can return it… and then don\u0026rsquo;t.)\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re unhappy with your BluBlockers, return them anytime you want. No trial period. I\u0026rsquo;ll give you your money back.\nTHE STEP FURTHER STUFF NOW…\nThen, ask yourself what else you can offer beyond a basic resolution of those concerns. You might not even need to make an explicit guarantee. Here are a few good examples.\nConsumer Hero (A $5 membership club for buying used electronics at discount prices)\n\u0026ldquo;But what if you never buy from us and your two-year membership expires? Fine. Send us just your membership card and we\u0026rsquo;ll fully refund your five dollars\u0026mdash;plus send you interest on your money.\u0026rdquo;\nPrecise Builder\nTry the software 6 months risk-free. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t loving Precise Builder after that, you get your money back. We\u0026rsquo;ll even help you find and set up a better software for your company.\n\u0026ldquo;Beyond Warranty\u0026rdquo; Guarantees\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you\u0026rsquo;re highly skilled at coming up with \u0026ldquo;yeah, but… \u0026quot; statements. Yeah, but what about after the warranty.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah, but, can I return it if I wear it?\u0026rdquo; And so forth. (Include something funny about relationships.)\nOr, I don\u0026rsquo;t care what it is, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to buy a new one every year.\nThe following examples don\u0026rsquo;t make official guarantees beyond the limited warranty, but they still make (me, anyways) feel better that I\u0026rsquo;ll get plenty of value well past the protected trial period.\nSensor 770 Watch\nThe Sensor 770 has an unprecedented five-year parts and labor unconditional warranty. Each watch goes through weeks of aging, testing and quality control before assembly and final inspection. Service should never be required, but if it should anytime during the five-year warranty period, we will pick up your Sensor at your door and send you a loaner watch while yours is being repaired–all at our expense.\n(I like the use of service never being required. And, they replace the watch while yours is being repaired, if needed. They said all this twice in the same print ad.)\nWe have selected the Sensor as the most advanced American-made, solid-state timepiece ever produced. And we put our company and its full resources behind that selection. JS\u0026amp;A will unconditionally guarantee the Sensor–even the battery–for five years.

Also, lets people know that it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get serviced as needed.)\nFarmco\nFarmco offers a seven year warranty on their cattle and horse feeders. But the copy goes on to show the products are built to last decades. It also establishes authority.\n7-Year Product Warranty for Farmers The Farmco team built our first feeders back in the 1970s—right here on the family farm. So we know firsthand what it takes for equipment to hold up to real farming. And we stand behind that claim—with no-cost replacements and repairs on defective feeders and parts for a full seven years after purchase. But you won’t need it. Because our feeders are built to last decades in the field. And with normal farm-tough use and some light maintenance, you’ll be saving time, money and labor for years to come.\n","date":"2023-09-07","id":10,"permalink":"/docs/psych_triggers/the-satisfaction-conviction/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e(maybe I should intro this as the agreement in the S.B. framework)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter you\u0026rsquo;ve explained your offer, many buyers will still be on the fence.
