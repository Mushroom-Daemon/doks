Sarah\u0026hellip; Teddy\u0026hellip; who?\nWelcome to the Kickass Copy Playbook—a practical, user-friendly guide to writing kickass copy that converts.\nThe Kickass Copy Playbook was written for anyone interested in persuasive writing—whether you write ads for a living, hope to suade donors or volunteers to give more of themselves, or just want to convince the girl next door you\u0026rsquo;re totally worth it. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried it all, and through my sucesses and mistakes have learned a thing or two that work. You\u0026rsquo;ll find that here. \u0026hellip; improve clik-thru\u0026hellip; whatever.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s more to it than that. I\u0026rsquo;ve also learned and stolen from some of the best. Direct-response legends like Eugene Schwartz, Joseph Sugarman, Mel Martin, Gary Halpbert, Gary Bencivenga, Tom McElligot, and more. All folks who\u0026rsquo;ve moved hearts, minds, and a hell of a lot of money through the power of the written word.\nHere you\u0026rsquo;ll find a step-by-step the tips, tricks, and teachings as laid out by these masters.

The \u0026ldquo;Persuasion Playbook\u0026rdquo; (better name) gets into the heart of persuasion—how to attract, inspire, move your prospect and create change. Many (most) of the persuasive bits covered here are from Joseph Sugarman\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Triggers\u0026rdquo; as covered in his great book, the Adweek \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve also mixed in lots of other things I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up along the way and organized the material in a way that, I think, makes sense.\nRead each section one at a time. Reflect on the teachings and ask yourself how do you relate to them. Where have you seen this, experienced it for yourself? How do you already know this stuff?\nYou have to write.

Learning to do this is a superpower that must be treated with wielded responsibly. It is a means of manipulation.\nDoing so, in my most humble opinion, is not about trickery.\nThis is a guiding principle–without it, the other persuasive elements might as well be useless; they may work for a time, but the truth always comes out Write with integrity Only write it if you believe it If you believe it, others will too—this gives you credibility the ad is a reflection of the company, yes, but also you (is this a separate thing? credibility with persuasion and integrity with writing?)\nCredibility is about being believable—perhaps the most persuasive element of all. if someone doesn’t believe you, they don’t trust you, and you aren’t going to inspire them to act. The moment the reader says no or i don’t believe this or I don’t think this is me, they’re gone. You’ve lost them. On the flip side, people will do crazy shit for something they believe in—love, this, this… Crazy, crazy shit. (heck, they might even read all of your copy.)\nTo be believable, be honest. Raise common objections and air them out in the light of day—own them. Tell your prospects why. Be specific with your copy. Answer questions/Keep your communication straight-forward, honest, and credible. Don’t beat around the bush. And don’t make shit up.\nAlign yourself with your thoughts, words, and deeds So there you have it. Your first lesson. Don’t make shit up.

Under \u0026ldquo;The Big Ones\u0026rdquo;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the most important thing is persuasive writing:\nGetting people to read your copy. It isn\u0026rsquo;t hard to do.\nBut there are a few practical steps you need to be aware of. For one, your copy should be easy to read. That means no big words and no long sentences. No giants blocks of text.\nemotional outpouring\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;BE that person, the tired mom, the lazy bitch, the person who\u0026rsquo;s riddled with insecurity (you? never.) \u0026hellip; my trainwell thing I sent to darian is pretty dope\u0026hellip;\nTo get people to read your copy, make it easy to read.\nDo not be subtle. Be bold. And say what you need to say over and over and over again.\nWrite all the time. Letters and postcards. Every opportunity that you can. Never worry about it being good. Just write.\nLearn all sorts of things you\u0026rsquo;ll never need. It make ayou a better copywriter and writer. It gives you something to write about!\nwrite to ONE person. it\u0026rsquo;s only one person reading the ad. My secret website. I have a secret website. It\u0026rsquo;s where I post all sorts of things NSFW. My girlfriend sometimes reads it, which is embarassing, for both of us. I write to one guy. Very personal. From me to you. Period. (Just like how I wrote this.)\nuse a byline with your name and write in first person. or, introduce yourself in the into.\nevery communication is a personal one.\nCLARITY\nright short sentences. They\u0026rsquo;re easy to read. folks don\u0026rsquo;t want t try too hard. You want people to read your ads. Short sentences are easy to understand, too. that\u0026rsquo;s I portant. it makes them more likely to buy from you. When people understand your ads, they\u0026rsquo;re more likely to buy what you\u0026rsquo;re selling. when your ads are easy to understand, people are more likely to buy from you. this isn\u0026rsquo;t the place for clever turns of phrase or fancy language or double meaning. hammer out the main bits. do it clearly.\ndon\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to start your sentences with \u0026ldquo;And.\u0026rdquo; And \u0026ldquo;because.\u0026rdquo; Or \u0026ldquo;or.\u0026rdquo; Read some Vonnegut\nI love this writing. I find it rather audacious. never use words like audacious in your copy. it makes you sound like a pompous ass.\nFEAR\nAs a copywriter, you\u0026rsquo;re paid to come up with ideas. Good ones, ideally. Ideas that help your clients get paid. And you need to know how to write, too.\nLike all creative work, a bit of magic is involved. You can\u0026rsquo;t really claim your ideas. They aren\u0026rsquo;t yours… they just come from someplace. And that can be a little scary—what if they don\u0026rsquo;t come?\nI think one of the hardest parts about this, esp in the beginning, of getting paid to come up with ideas is the fear of not being able to do it. there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of resistance there, right at the beginning. the ideas come from thin air, they land on your shoulder. when I first started writing copy, before every assignment is thin \u0026ldquo;how the hell am I going to pull this off?\u0026rdquo;\nwhat if one doesn\u0026rsquo;t come? or what if you\u0026rsquo;re tasked with something you\u0026rsquo;ve never done before? something without a guidebook? it can feel like a lot of pressure. the good news is it\u0026rsquo;s totally doable, and one thing always works…\nWHAT WORKS\nI once read a book filled with nothing but transcribed interviews of successful peope. transcript from an interview that had been included in a book of other interviews. I don\u0026rsquo;t rememeber who the person was or what they did or really anything at all about the context except for this lick:\n\u0026ldquo;when nothing works, work works.\u0026rdquo;\ni\u0026rsquo;ve since shortened it to work works and make it your motto for overcoming fear.\nit means that if you sit your ass down and take it one step at a time (those steps revealed here in a moment) focus on your task (more on that later) the words will come. the ideas will present themselves. you will sift through the grainy river bottom a river of self doubt shit and find the filtering gold buried inside. and it will be fun. and people will think you\u0026rsquo;re some kind of genius.\nsometimes I just make work goals w my creative writing. like, take this crap sorry I wrote and work on it one hour this week. twenty minutes at a time or whatever. cut parts out, add stuff in, play around and figure what it\u0026rsquo;s all about. something always happens. there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of gold in there.\nso how do you work? what is the work of making something from nothing? here\u0026rsquo;s the first step: gather information. squirrel it away, stuffing your chipmunk cheeks, some other rodent thing. focus on what you know. sweep the mess into piles and let form reveal itself. it\u0026rsquo;s in there, the glittering gold your sifting for at the river bank. it reveals itself. it just requires some attention.\nthe writing is getting a huge shovel full of river bed and dumping it onto your sifter. editing is the finding gold part.\nwhen in doubt, KEEP WORKING. When I was writing this site, many times it went easy. but other times, i\u0026rsquo;d have trouble determining how to include something in the table of contents, if doubt myself, i\u0026rsquo;d say why am I doing this—no one\u0026rsquo;s going to use it. no one cares. etc. but now it lives and that feels good. you can have that satisfaction, too. i\u0026rsquo;m too old, I should have done this when I was 15. I have too much coming up, this is a waste of time. there are real problems in the world, I should apply myself to those. but you know what? fuck all that. grind through and finish the project.\nWHAT DO THEY WANT\nI took a trumpet lesson one time. god, the questionnaire… I still don\u0026rsquo;t know what you WANT. so you have to ask peope questions in a way that\u0026rsquo;s common and simple and makes sense. don\u0026rsquo;t ask what your customer wants. ask what they buy.\nthen ask why. these desires, there aren\u0026rsquo;t many of them. you can skip over the basic survival ones. if someone is starving to death they don\u0026rsquo;t give a god damn about the porch you\u0026rsquo;re selling. people want to get laid, they want to be seen as successful because they want to get laid. they want to belong to community.\nFOCUS\npomodoro. you can\u0026rsquo;t get a ton done in 25 min. I use 33.33. at first, it may challenge you. you\u0026rsquo;re building a muscle. get rid of your phone. work in a distraction free environment. I prefer total silence, cold and hungry ravenously chewing gum. mileage may vary.\nthe timer trains you. the timer is a technical doc thing too. protect your time. get away from phone. turn off slack. nothing is so urgent it can\u0026rsquo;t wait a few hours. tell your PM your work style.\na power session is 33.33 plus a fifteen min break. for creative work, breaks not only help? they are essential. bill a 33.33 min and 15 min break as 49 min. anyone has a prob with that send them to me. you will be astonished at how quickly and high caliber you can c get your work done. bill this. any probs, send them…\nPOISON\nmurakami says writers have poison in them, and I believe this to be true. the thing is,too much poison\u0026rsquo;ll kill ya. smokin? drinkin, you gotta keep it in check.\nExercise (for your mind and body).\nwhat else is my secret power? mania. how do I feed that mania? chewing. eating. where is your destruction? stop feeding it. let it feed you.\nEDIT\nSometimes writers are free and easy and don\u0026rsquo;t try too hard and come up with stuff that is really, really fucking cool.\nThe rest of us need to edit.\nProbably a lot.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s the best part:\nWhen you start to feel overwhelmed and lost, walk the fuck away. also the clean desk. This helps a lot. And clear your desktop and close tabs. This is the creative mind stuff. I think it has to be clear. Silence.\n\u0026ldquo;Look at the act of writing the first draft as giving brith. It may be a painful, long process or it can go quite quickly and with little pain. Then compare the editing process to raising the child—the caring and nurturing required to ensure a healthy, happy child.\u0026rdquo;\nEDITING\nGetting your copy to express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words. Expressing the thoughts and emotions you want to convey with the fewest words.\nTips:\nLook for \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rdquo; and remove Vary sentence length for a good rhythm Hyphenate sentences to make them shorter Eliminate unnesseccary words Rearrange thoughts Try to find periodicials and remove as many words as possible.\n","date":"2023-09-07","id":16,"permalink":"/writing/writing_tips/writing_tips/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ejust get started and you\u0026rsquo;ll get better and better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this goes under the research part.

After poking around online, I found one I liked and walked to a local shop to see if they could order for me. They could.\nThey actually had a few in the shop. I hopped on one and thought it felt great. I ordered the model I wanted online and excitedly awaited my present to myself.\nthis is about the stress and worry of making the wrong choice. louie took that away and gave me confidence.

When I pulled up he stopped and was very complimentary of my new ride.\nclearly, throw guy new what he was talking about, so I told him my concern: the size?\nWhen I got there, they actually had a few of the model I liked in stock. I rode one around for a bit, thought it was great. I told them I wanted to place an order on Black Friday through the manufacturer and they said that was all good with them, and they\u0026rsquo;d still assemble the bike in the shop\u0026ndash;which ended up being kind of a hassle for them.\nwhat made him a pro? he loves it. he was talking about the features, the paint job, and he just looks like a cyclist. he has the build. I instantly trusted his opinion, for better or worse.\nIn this case it was for the better.\nFor starters, the manufacturer sent the wrong bike, so they had to pack it back up and return it. Then, the sent the right bike, but I became the problem. For some reason, it felt too big for me. I couldn’t stand over the bike without getting racked, for one. And the whole thing just felt too big. I was going back and forth and back and forth until someone set me straight.\nIt was my mailman. He saw me whip around the corner on my new wheels and wanted to talk all about it. This guy, Louie, to me, is an expert. He walks something like eight hours a day, and when he isn\u0026rsquo;t on foot, he\u0026rsquo;s riding around town on his road bike or cargo bike. The dude knows and loves bikes, something he made clear while admiring my new whip.\nI told him I was self-conscious about the size choice. He asked if it was because I thought it was too big, which I did. I then explained my complaints to him and he said he believes a person should love their bike\u0026mdash;that way they\u0026rsquo;ll ride it. And I should go through the hassle of returning it. So I did.\nHis authority and strong opinion on the matter\u0026mdash;just knowing and loving bikes\u0026mdash;helped me make a tough decision with confidence. His reassurance made it okay for me to go with what I thought. I took his advice and now I have a bike I love\u0026ndash;and his my mailman\u0026rsquo;s expert validation and reassurance played no small part in that.

For instead of trying to tell you what a great product the Magic Stat thermostat is, we\u0026rsquo;re going to tear it apart. Unmercifully. (tease what\u0026rsquo;s to come.)\nBut wait, we did find one good feature—a feature that led us to a discovery.

Its closest competition is a $250 recorder called the Lanier endorsed by a famous gold star. Fancy Endorsement The famous gold star is a pilot who personally flies his own Citation jet. The Olympus recorder is endorsed by JS\u0026amp;A’s president who pilots a more cost-efficient single engine Beechcraft Bonanza. The gold star does not endorse the Lanier unit for free. After all, a good portion of his income is derived from endorsing products. Our president, on the other hand, does not get paid for endorsing products–just for selling them.

Selling things in copy requires a slightly different approach than selling them on the lot. Basically, you\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing but words and the reader\u0026rsquo;s imagination to do the job. They can\u0026rsquo;t kick the tires, try on the boots, or kiss their mail-order bride.\nSo you\u0026rsquo;ve got to help them feel those feels. To do that, involve all the senses, get them to imagine touching, using, smelling, hearing your product. See through your eyes, touch through your hands, smell through your nose or feel your feelings.\nIn print, spell out how they\u0026rsquo;ll use the product in a practical way. Hypnotize them. carry them through the imagery of ownership, of how they\u0026rsquo;ll use the product.\nLoosen the tongue and slide on your boots, sinch the laces down and quickly thread them through the speed hooks (faster and faster the more you wear your boots). The leather softens and molds to your feet, for a fit that\u0026rsquo;s all yours and comfortable all day long.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t sell them a patio. Sell them the feel of cool stone under their feet on a summer\u0026rsquo;s evening.\nHave them take a stroll. Have them easily slip on and go for a run in their new shoes, light as air and soft on the ground.\nHold the Litronix2000 in your hand. See how easily the keys snap to the touch. See how small and light the unit it.\nTake a ride in the new Corvette. Feel the breeze blowing through your hair as you drive through the warm evening. Watch heads turn. Punch the accelerator to the floor and feel the burst of power that pins you into the back of your contour seat. Look at the beautiful display of electronic technology right on your dashboard. Feel the power and excitement of Americ\u0026rsquo;s super sports car.\nTalk to them as if they already own the product. The more vividily they can see that, the more ready they\u0026rsquo;ll be to make that vision of themselves a reality. Make them believe they are experiencing those things. Fill the vacuum of their mind with the image of what they will be enjoying with your product.\nThe more you get them involved in that feeling of ownership, the closer you are to a sale.\nIn person, get them to actually use it.

You do this with your Satisfaction Conviction.\nNaturally, we all have our worries. Your job is to take that worry away.\nThe Satisfaction Conviction is the late-night television salesman saying \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so convinced you\u0026rsquo;ll love this product, I\u0026rsquo;m going to do something crazy.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s a complete risk-reversal, where you show your clients they have nothing to lose.\nDone right, your satisfaction conviction should make your prospects think:\n• Your product or service must truly be phenomenal\nand/or…\n• You (the supplier) are probably going to get taken advantage of\nFor a great example of a Satisfaction Conviction, check out REI\u0026rsquo;s return policy:\nWRITE MY EXAMPLE OF PRECISE BUILDER.\nWhat makes this return policy so great is not just its length\u0026mdash;a generous year long return window (more on that in a minute), but that the great can be returned used. They\u0026rsquo;re essentially letting member kick the tires out in the real world for a full year. Try it out. Give it hell.

What are the most common hesitations or concerns you hear about your product? And don\u0026rsquo;t just assume it\u0026rsquo;s always about money. they worried about losing money? A failing product? Difficulty using your product or getting it serviced?\nIf I go to the grocery store or a box of crackers, I might be worried I don\u0026rsquo;t like the taste, or they\u0026rsquo;re stale. Tell me I can bring them back if think they suck and I\u0026rsquo;m happy.\nBut what if I\u0026rsquo;m more concerned with… Some other example… For example, you might be worried the crackers you buy at the grocery store taste bad, or are stale. The money you spend on software might be wasted if you can\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to use it.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t guess\u0026mdash;ask.\nA Note on Money-Back Trials and Warranties\n(A note on trial periods: typically, the longer the trial the better, and the less it gets taken advantage of. If you offer a two-week trial period, the customer will likely be thinking of whether or not they actually want the product in that two weeks. Make it longer and they relax. They know they can return it… and then don\u0026rsquo;t.)\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re unhappy with your BluBlockers, return them anytime you want. No trial period. I\u0026rsquo;ll give you your money back.\nTHE STEP FURTHER STUFF NOW…\nThen, ask yourself what else you can offer beyond a basic resolution of those concerns. You might not even need to make an explicit guarantee. Here are a few good examples.\nConsumer Hero (A $5 membership club for buying used electronics at discount prices)\n\u0026ldquo;But what if you never buy from us and your two-year membership expires? Fine. Send us just your membership card and we\u0026rsquo;ll fully refund your five dollars\u0026mdash;plus send you interest on your money.\u0026rdquo;\nPrecise Builder\nTry the software 6 months risk-free. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t loving Precise Builder after that, you get your money back. We\u0026rsquo;ll even help you find and set up a better software for your company.\n\u0026ldquo;Beyond Warranty\u0026rdquo; Guarantees\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you\u0026rsquo;re highly skilled at coming up with \u0026ldquo;yeah, but… \u0026quot; statements. Yeah, but what about after the warranty.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah, but, can I return it if I wear it?\u0026rdquo; And so forth. (Include something funny about relationships.)\nOr, I don\u0026rsquo;t care what it is, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to buy a new one every year.\nThe following examples don\u0026rsquo;t make official guarantees beyond the limited warranty, but they still make (me, anyways) feel better that I\u0026rsquo;ll get plenty of value well past the protected trial period.\nSensor 770 Watch\nThe Sensor 770 has an unprecedented five-year parts and labor unconditional warranty. Each watch goes through weeks of aging, testing and quality control before assembly and final inspection. Service should never be required, but if it should anytime during the five-year warranty period, we will pick up your Sensor at your door and send you a loaner watch while yours is being repaired–all at our expense.\n(I like the use of service never being required. And, they replace the watch while yours is being repaired, if needed. They said all this twice in the same print ad.)\nWe have selected the Sensor as the most advanced American-made, solid-state timepiece ever produced. And we put our company and its full resources behind that selection. JS\u0026amp;A will unconditionally guarantee the Sensor–even the battery–for five years.

But the copy goes on to show the products are built to last decades. It also establishes authority.\n7-Year Product Warranty for Farmers The Farmco team built our first feeders back in the 1970s—right here on the family farm. So we know firsthand what it takes for equipment to hold up to real farming. And we stand behind that claim—with no-cost replacements and repairs on defective feeders and parts for a full seven years after purchase. But you won’t need it. Because our feeders are built to last decades in the field. And with normal farm-tough use and some light maintenance, you’ll be saving time, money and labor for years to come.\n","date":"2023-09-07","id":60,"permalink":"/docs/psych_triggers/the-satisfaction-conviction/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e(maybe I should intro this as the agreement in the S.B. framework)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter you\u0026rsquo;ve explained your offer, many buyers will still be on the fence.
